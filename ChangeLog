	Reproduce the behavior when playing a sound at a sample rate which
	is not 11025 or 22050Hz.  This is to "fix" a bug in Scientist 2:
	however, it does not fix the playing of sounds, only silence
	them.  I tested Vanilla Doom and this is how it behaves when it
	receives sound effects with odd sample rates.  The bug here is
	actually in the Scientist 2 WAD, which has sound effects that
	have the wrong sample rate.
