	autoadjustment.  Fix crash with autoadjust when running windowed.

2008-01-20 04:59:50 fraggle
	
	Add -width, -height command line parameters for specifying the screen
	mode.

2008-01-20 04:47:52 fraggle
	
	Refactor the video mode configuration system.  The previous system was
	built around the program choosing a screen mode from the user's
	settings, this is based around choosing settings from the specified
	screen mode.  As such, the old screenmultiply config variable is now
	gone.  Also, aspect ratio correction is now on by default.  Add new

	sign conversion in the endianness code.

	z_zone one.

2007-06-17 19:40:02 fraggle
	
	Split i_sound.c into i_sdlsound.c, i_sdlmusic.c, with generic "sound

	Support up to 20 joystick buttons.  Justification: most modern
	joysticks and joypads have many more than four buttons.  Keeping the
	limit at four buttons restricts the player into using the first four
	buttons on his joystick/pad, which could be any arbitrary four set of
	buttons.

2007-06-14 22:03:22 fraggle
	
	Don't send joystick updates when the joystick is disabled.  Shut up

2007-03-16 21:43:28 fraggle

2007-03-16 05:07:35 rtc_marine
	
	Update codeblocks project

2007-03-15 18:43:22 fraggle
	
	Change MD5 code to use the standard types used elsewhere in the
	program.

2007-03-15 18:38:55 fraggle
	
	Use SDL for endianness byte swapping.  m_swap.c removed; m_swap.h
	renamed to i_swap.h.

2007-03-14 13:05:03 fraggle
	
	Use SDL's built-in audio conversion routines to convert sound effects
	to the output mixer device's sample rate.  Simplistic (naive)
	resampling in cases where SDL's routines can't do a conversion.  This
	needs a bit more work to filter out the high frequency artifacts at
	48khz output rate.

2007-03-12 12:38:54 fraggle
	
	Change "sound effects enabled" checkbox to a dropdown, allowing PC
	speaker to be selected as well.

2007-03-10 07:48:21 rtc_marine
	
	Minor changes:
	* No more shared libraries on windows, because they suck anyway and
	  complicate things
	* Fix build virtual targets

2007-03-10 05:40:12 fraggle
	
	Ignore the HOME environment variable on Windows - just behave like
	Vanilla Doom.

2007-03-10 02:11:18 rtc_marine
	
	Lots of changes/additions:
	* Add libpcsound codeblocks project
	* Use libraries that are built and project dependencies inside main
	  chocolate-doom/setup project and remove source files.
	* libraries are now built in the "lib" top level directory
	* Fix some warnings

2007-03-09 23:30:46 fraggle
	
	Add pcsound Linux driver.

2007-03-09 23:03:24 fraggle
	
	Don't build console mode apps; use the default -mwindows until the
	stdout.txt/stderr.txt thing can be fixed.

2007-03-09 22:50:48 fraggle
	
	Move the pcsound library to the top level, alongside textscreen.

2007-03-09 22:20:28 fraggle
	
	Partially revert the last change.  I'm going with a mixed approach for
	handling key mappings.  Chocolate Doom will use the original (broken)
	Doom behavior, in that keys will be unmapped.  A German user will have
	to type "IDMZPOS", for example.  However, when actually entering text,
	for savegame names and multiplayer chat, the mapped character will be
	used.  The reasoning here is that Vanilla users will be used to
	pressing the wrong keys, but it can never be desirable to use the
	wrong mappings when typing in text.

2007-03-09 12:56:45 fraggle
	
	Pay closer attention to keyboard mappings.  In the menu code,
	distinguish between keys pressed and characters typed, so that, for
	example, when the menu prompts "press 'y' to continue", it responds to
	the _character_ y being typed, not the key that is 'y' on an american
	keyboard being pressed.  Do the same when reading cheats.

2007-03-09 12:35:18 fraggle
	
	Fix discrepancy between Doom and setup program when prompting for
	keys.  Add the ability to enable/disable key mappings so that the raw
	key can be read in setup, exactly the same way that it is in Doom.

2007-03-07 23:52:33 rtc_marine
	
	Update project Fix a warning

2007-03-07 19:08:27 fraggle

2007-02-23 23:26:26 fraggle
	
	Add a configuration file value to allow the SDL video driver to be
	explicitly specified.

2007-02-15 21:51:53 fraggle
	
	Really fix the menu corruption bug.

2007-02-14 19:11:30 fraggle
	
	Make I_Error call abort() instead of exit(), so that we can get a
	backtrace in the debugger.

2007-02-14 19:11:03 fraggle
	
	Expand buffer length to fix bug on Windows with cycling character on
	the quicksave screen.

2007-02-14 19:10:30 fraggle
	
	Read sound length as a 32 bit field, not 16 bit.  Fixes death sound in
	marina.wad.

2007-02-10 03:19:30 fraggle
	
	Don't prepend a superfluous './' to the path when searching the
	current directory for an IWAD.

2007-02-07 13:04:46 fraggle
	
	Revert previous change: throwing away the key state seems to be the
	Doom 1.9 behavior.

2007-02-07 12:58:53 fraggle
	
	Don't throw away keypress state when passing between levels - allows
	shift to be held down for run when moving between levels.  Thanks to
	Zack Friedrich <zack18@comcast.net> for pointing this out.

2007-02-01 12:21:14 fraggle
	
	Search IWAD search directories when loading PWAD files.

2007-01-14 05:20:28 fraggle
	
	Fix savegamedir directory generation.

2007-01-14 05:04:37 fraggle
	
	Change interpretation of DOOMWADDIR to the classic behavior: a single
	directory path where an IWAD can be found.  Add DOOMWADPATH as a
	PATH-style list of directories to search for IWADs.  This is to
	maintain consistency/compatibility with other ports, and so that the
	DOOMWADDIR name makes sense.

2007-01-08 22:46:05 fraggle
	
	More helpful SDL_mixer error messages.

2007-01-08 22:45:18 fraggle

	by setup.exe.

2006-09-16 01:04:59 fraggle

2006-09-02 20:10:07 fraggle
	
	Add -nwtmerge option, which behaves the same as NWT's -merge option.
	What this does is load a PWAD, then search through the IWAD sprites
	list, removing lumps where there are lumps of the same name in the
	PWAD.  The PWAD must then be loaded again with the normal -file
	option.  This is needed to run TiC's Obituary TC: chocolate-doom
	-nwtmerge obtic2.wad -file obtic1.wad obtic2.wad -deh obtic1.deh Also

2006-09-01 21:07:25 fraggle
	
	Better spechits emulation.  Remove support for emulating the
	higher-memory spechits overruns, as they will overwrite pointers with
	garbage and crash the game.  Change the spechits base address to one
	from doom2.exe, which seems to work better in more cases.  Add
	-spechit command-line parameter to allow the base address to be
	explicitly specified if necessary.

2006-08-31 23:11:08 fraggle
	
	Call R_ExecuteSetViewSize immediately after calling I_InitGraphics.
	I_InitGraphics can change where screens[0] points to, so the player

	Oops :-)

2006-07-22 17:43:12 fraggle

	dedicated servers (no need to allocate an entire heap).

2006-03-24 19:55:04 fraggle
	
	Make memblock_t internal to z_zone.c.  Adjust Z_ChangeTag #define to
	cope with this.

2006-03-16 21:46:59 fraggle
	
	Fix crasher when starting new levels, because the intermissions code

	it does not fix the playing of sounds, only silence them.  I tested
	Vanilla Doom and this is how it behaves when it receives sound effects
	with odd sample rates.  The bug here is actually in the Scientist 2
