# Put CVS lock files in this directory rather than directly in the repository.

# Set `TopLevelAdmin' to `yes' to create a CVS directory at the top
# level of the new working directory when using the `cvs checkout'
# command.
#TopLevelAdmin=no

# Set `LogHistory' to `all' or `TOEFWUPCGMAR' to log all transactions to the
# history file, or a subset as needed (ie `TMAR' logs all write operations)
#LogHistory=TOEFWUPCGMAR

# Set `RereadLogAfterVerify' to `always' (the default) to allow the verifymsg
# script to change the log message.  Set it to `stat' to force CVS to verify# that the file has changed before reading it (this can take up to an extra
# second per directory being committed, so it is not recommended for large
# repositories.  Set it to `never' (the previous CVS behavior) to prevent
# verifymsg scripts from changing the log message.
#RereadLogAfterVerify=always
