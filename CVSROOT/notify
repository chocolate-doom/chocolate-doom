# The "notify" file controls where notifications from watches set by
# "cvs watch add" or "cvs edit" are sent.  The first entry on a line is
# a regular expression which is tested against the directory that the
# change is being made to, relative to the $CVSROOT.  If it matches,
# then the remainder of the line is a filter program that should contain
# one occurrence of %s for the user to notify, and information on its
# standard input.
#
# "ALL" or "DEFAULT" can be used in place of the regular expression.
#
# For example:
#ALL mail -s "CVS notification" %s
