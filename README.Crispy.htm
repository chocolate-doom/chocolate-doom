<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Synopsis"> Synopsis </span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom is a fork of <a href="http://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom" title="Chocolate Doom">Chocolate Doom</a> that provides a higher display resolution, removes the <a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Static_limits" class="extiw" title="doom:Static limits">static limits</a>
 of the Doom engine and offers further optional visual, tactical and 
physical enhancements while remaining entirely config file, savegame, 
netplay and demo <a href="#Compatibility">compatibile</a> with the original.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Objectives"> Objectives </span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom is a source port that aims to provide a faithful Doom 
gaming experience while also featuring some user-requested improvements 
and enhancements. It is forked off of Chocolate Doom to take advantage 
of its free and open-source code base, portability, accuracy and 
compatibility with Vanilla Doom.
</p><p>Its core features are:
</p>
<ul><li> Enhanced 640x400 display resolution, with the original 320x200 resolution still available in the "Graphics Detail: Low" mode.
</li><li> Removal of all static engine limits, or at least raising of the less crucial ones.
</li><li> Full support for the "Doom Classic" WADs shipped with the 
"Doom 3: BFG Edition", especially the "No Rest For The Living" episode 
shipped in the NERVE.WAD file.
</li></ul>
<p>Furthermore, the following optional user-visible features are available:
</p>
<ul><li> Jumping.
</li><li> Free vertical looking, including mouse look and vertical aiming.
</li><li> A new minimal Crispy HUD, displaying only the status bar numbers.
</li><li> Colorized status bar numbers, HUD texts and blood sprites for certain monsters.
</li><li> Tranlucency for certain sprites and status bar elements in the Crispy HUD.
</li><li> Randomly mirrored death animations and corpse sprites.
</li><li> Players may walk over or under monsters and hanging corpses.
</li><li> Aiming support by a crosshair that may get directly rendered into the game world.
</li><li> Centered Weapons when firing, weapon recoil thrust and pitch.
</li><li> Reports whenever a secret is revealed.
</li><li> Level statistics in the Automap.
</li></ul>
<p>All of these features are disabled by default and need to get enabled
 either in the in-game "Crispness" menu or in the crispy-doom-setup 
tool. They are implemented in a way that preserves demo-compatibility 
with Vanilla Doom and network game compatibility with Chocolate Doom. 
Furthermore, Crispy Doom's savegames and config files are compatible, <a href="#Compatibility">though not identical</a>, to Vanilla Doom's.
</p><p>Crispy Doom strives for maximum compatibility with all 
"limit-removing Vanilla" maps -- but not Boom or ZDoom maps. Many 
additional less user-visible features have been implemented, e.g. fixed 
engine limitations and crashes, fixed rendering bugs, fixed harmless 
game logic bugs, full support for DEHACKED files and lumps in BEX 
format, additional and improved cheat codes, an improved Automap, and 
many more! For a detailed list of features and changes please refer to 
the release notes below.
</p><p>Crispy Heretic, Crispy Hexen and Crispy Strife are also available
 but do currently only feature the resolution enhancements, but none of 
the other features mentioned here.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_of_Crispy_Doom_2.3_from_Crispy_Doom_2.2"> Changes of Crispy Doom 2.3 from Crispy Doom 2.2 </span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom 2.3 has been released on March 4, 2015.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Automap_improvements"> Automap improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> The Automap now has an <b>Overlay Mode</b> that draws the map directly onto the player view and that can be toggled by pressing '<tt>O</tt>'.
</li><li> The Automap now has a <b>Rotate Mode</b> that -- as the name 
suggests -- keeps the player arrow oriented upwards and rotates the 
entire map instead. It can be toggled by pressing the '<tt>R</tt>' key and fits nicely into the Automap Overlay Mode.
</li><li> If Follow Mode is disabled and Overlay Mode is enabled, instead of panning through the map, it will remain static.
</li><li> The extra triangle for the player is not drawn anymore if the <tt>IDDT</tt> cheat is enabled.
</li><li> If Follow Mode is enabled an actual crosshair is drawn instead of a single point.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Cheats_improvements"> Cheats improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> A new "<tt>NOMOMENTUM</tt>" cheat has been added -- that is, 
merely enabled, all the code has already been there before -- that 
avoids the player from gaining momentum. It is called a "debug aid" in 
the source code and is pretty useless unless you want to position the 
player at an exact position.
</li><li> A "gibs" sound is now played if a dead player is resurrected by the <tt>IDDQD</tt> cheat.
</li><li> Players are now given full in-air control in <tt>IDCLIP</tt> mode. Thanks Linguica for the idea.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="New_features"> New features </span></h3>
<ul><li> The <b>secret E1M10 map</b> present exclusively in the XBOX 
variant of The Ultimate Doom is now supported. The map is entered by 
triggering a secret, erm, "wall" in E1M1 and exits to E1M2. The map name
 is right in both the Automap and the Intermission screen and the blood 
splat is drawn in the latter, though only once. To enter the map with a 
cheat code, type <tt>IDCLEV10</tt>; to warp there from the command line, type "<tt>-warp 1 A</tt>"
 (or any other letter for the map). Thanks to Ronald Lasmanowicz of 
Wii-Doom for some suggestions regarding the implementation. If you want 
to try out this feature but do not own the XBOX variant of <tt>DOOM.WAD</tt>, try the patch posted here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/71374-patch-ultimate-doom-1-9-xbox-doom/">http://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/71374-patch-ultimate-doom-1-9-xbox-doom/</a> .
</li><li> The <b>texture files</b> (<tt>TEXTURE1/2</tt> lumps) and <b>patch lookup tables</b> (<tt>PNAMES</tt> lumps) from PWADs do not override those of the IWAD anymore. Instead, up to 8 <tt>TEXTURE1/2</tt> lumps and up to 4 PNAMES lumps <b>get merged</b>, so that all textures from all loaded WADs are available. This makes it possible to e.g. run "<tt>crispy-doom -iwad freedoom2.wad -file doom1.wad</tt>", which loads the <i>Freedoom: Phase 2</i> IWAD and replaces all textures which are also present in the <i>Doom 1 Shareware</i> WAD but leaves all others intact.
</li><li> <b>Weapon Pitch</b> has been added as a new feature and fits nicely if combined with Weapon Recoil.
</li><li> The <b>static crosshair</b> has been added back. It is now drawn as the HU font's '<tt>+</tt>'
 character in the center of the screen and is rendered translucent if 
that is globally enabled. It has become the default, the crosshair 
rendered into the game world has to get activated by a new dedicated 
switch.
</li><li> Support for <b>music in OGG or FLAC formats from lumps in PWADs</b> has been added. This means, it is possible to run e.g. DoomMetalVol4 by simply calling "<tt>crispy-doom -file DoomMetalVol4.wad</tt>". Please note that this feature is only available if Music is set to "Native MIDI".
</li><li> PWAD files and DEHCAKED patches that are located in the config directory (i.e. the same directory that holds the <tt>crispy-doom.cfg</tt> file) and that are named following the <tt>preloadN.{wad,deh,bex}</tt> naming scheme (with <tt>N=[0..9]</tt>) are <b>automatically pre-loaded at startup</b>. For example, Linux users may call "<tt>ln -s /path/to/DoomMetalVol4.wad ~/.crispy-doom/preload0.wad</tt>" to automate the call cited in the previous bullet point.
</li><li> It is now possible to <b>dump the result of the "<tt>-merge</tt>" parameter into a file</b> by means of the "<tt>-mergedump &lt;filename&gt;.wad</tt>"
 parameter. This is meant as a convenient "DEUSF replacement" for 
Vanilla Doom or other exotic source ports that still do not support the 
"-merge" feature. It is now possible to e.g create a portable variant of
 Requiem by calling "<tt>crispy-doom -iwad doom2.wad -file requiem.wad reqmus.wad req21fix.wad -mergedump req4all.wad</tt>".
 Please note that no duplicates are removed, so the resulting file gets 
rather big (about as big as the sum of all input files).
</li><li> Crispy Doom is now able to (re-)create <b>BLOCKMAP lumps</b> if they are either too small or too big or if requested by the user by the "<tt>-blockmap</tt>" parameter. The actual BLOCKMAP creation routine has been taken from Lee Killough's MBF source port.
</li><li> Crispy Doom is now able to load maps with <b>NODES lumps in either compressed or uncompressed ZDBSP format or DeePBSP format</b>
 and/or LINEDEFS and THINGS lumps in Hexen map format. The code is 
mostly adapted from PrBoom+ and Chocolate Hexen, though especially the 
ZDBSP nodes loading routine has been heavily modified, condensed and 
simplified. Please note that although it is now possible to load and 
explore maps in Hexen format, all interactions with their environment 
are most probably broken. Let me state that this feature has only been 
added because of a rejected patch of mine (tsts...) to add support for 
compressed ZDBSP nodes to PrBoom+.&nbsp;;)
</li><li> If running out of zone memory, Crispy Doom now allocates another zone of twice the size instead of crashing with a <b>Z_Malloc error</b>
 message. Please note that this turns Crispy Doom into a memory hog 
quite quickly, but it should only happen in very huge maps anyway and is
 still better than crashing.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Rendering_improvements"> Rendering improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> Wobbling long walls have been fixed, using e6y's beautiful fixed-point math formula which is also used in PrBoom+.
</li><li> Visplanes with the same flats now match up far better than 
before. Fixed using code adapted from PrBoom+, converted to fixed point 
math (and already merge back into PrBoom+).
</li><li> Some rendering glitches introduced by the Wiggle Fix (feature 
introduced in Crispy Doom 2.0) have been fixed, thanks to e6y and 
PrBoom+.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_improvements"> Minor improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> Lost Souls and spawned monsters are now counted in an extra 
variable that is displayed in the Automap stats next to the regular 
kills count, separated by a '<tt>+</tt>' sign. They are not added to the
 regular kills variable anymore which means one less (demo-critical) 
deviation from Vanilla behavior and one less switch in the Crispness 
menu. As a collateral damage, the special-casing of the Keen monsters in
 "<tt>-nomonsters</tt>" mode had to go as well, but that's to cope with.
</li><li> In the Crispy HUD, the health indicator now only blinks if below 10%.
</li><li> Weapon recoil is now applied after trajectories have been calculated.
</li><li> Warnings are now printed whenever <tt>SPECHITS</tt> or <tt>INTERCEPTS</tt> overflows are triggered.
</li><li> The previously selected savegame in the Load Game menu is now also pre-selected in the Save Game menu and the other way round.
</li><li> The <tt>braintargets</tt> limit has been removed. It was previously set to <tt>32</tt> and broke e.g. Speed of Doom's MAP30 which has <tt>40 braintargets</tt>.
</li></ul>

<p>Crispy Doom 2.2 has been released on January 2, 2015.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Laser_Pointer_improvements"> Laser Pointer improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> The laser spot now points to the center coordinates of the target.
</li><li> Laser spots are now solid instead of translucent. They became 
practically invisible too quickly, which was exactly not their purpose.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Cheats_improvements_2"> Cheats improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> New cheat: IDBEHOLD0 will reset all player powers.
</li><li> When the IDDQD cheat is activated after a player has died, his body is respawned at the current position.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Feature_review"> Feature review </span></h3>
<ul><li> The "center weapon sprite when firing" feature is now optional.
</li><li> The "colored blood" feature as well as the "fix lost soul and spectre blood" features are now optional.
</li><li> The "randomly mirrored corpses" feature is now optional.
</li><li> A second page has been added to the in-game "Crispness" menu to account for the added options.
</li><li> New optional feature: The "Kills" statistics are fixed, i.e. 
the "Kills" ratios shown after finishing a map or in the automap stats 
are adjusted each time a new monster is spawned on the map (e.g. in 
Nightmare mode, a Lost Soul spawned by a Pain Elemental, a monster 
resurrected by an Archiville or a monster spawned by a cube spitter). 
Furthermore, in "-nomonsters" games, Keens are now preserved but don't 
count towards the "Kills" statistics.
</li><li> If the "player may walk over/under monsters" feature is 
enabled, the player is now also able to walk under solid hanging 
corpses.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Further_improvements"> Further improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> In the Crispy HUD, the health indicator now blinks if it is below 10%. Somehow inspired by Doom Retro.
</li><li> Logging to stderr has been generally improved. Especially, the
 map slot, the WAD file and the skill are now printed whenever a map is 
loaded. Furthermore, absurd texture names in error messages have been 
fixed.
</li><li> Linedefs with the two-sided flag but without second sidedef 
are now fixed in a demo-compatible way, i.e. they are rendered as 
one-sided walls when a mid-texture is set and transparent else.
</li><li> Missing textures and flats do not lead to crashes anymore. 
Missing textures are rendered as HOM, i.e. black in Crispy Doom, and 
missing flats are replaced with the first flat available. In a very 
limited scope, this feature makes it possible to intermix resources and 
maps from different Doom missions.
</li><li> Most Slime Trails are removed when loading a map. This feature
 has been mostly taken from Lee Killough's implementation in MBF, but 
has been modified for demo-compatibility to not modify actual vertex 
coordinates, but instead dummy "pseudovertexes" that are only used in 
rendering.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Additional_Bug_fixes"> Additional Bug fixes </span></h3>
<ul><li> The patch color translations are now cleared after drawing the 
"Crispness" menu cursor. This could lead to the menu picture or the 
status bar being rendered too dark. Thanks to fistmarine for the bug 
report.
</li><li> Crashes in huge maps that occured due to the Wiggle-Fix 
(introduced in Crispy Doom 2,0) have been fixed. This has been done by 
upgrading the entire renderer to use 32-bit integer math. Thanks to kb1,
 RjY and Quasar for pointers to the relevant code changes!
</li><li> Crashes caused by the laser spot getting drawn behind the view plane have been fixed.
</li><li> The laser spot is not able to trigger an intercepts overflow anymore.
</li><li> A crash in maps with a cube spitter but without spawn spots (e.g. MAP04 in DV.WAD) has been fixed.
</li><li> A crash during map transitions has been fixed if a PWAD 
contains a stray MAP33 lump (e.g. INTIME.WAD). MAP33 is now only 
considered a regular map if the CWILV32 lump is also present.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_of_Crispy_Doom_2.1_from_Crispy_Doom_2.0"> Changes of Crispy Doom 2.1 from Crispy Doom 2.0 </span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom 2.1 has been released on November 12, 2014. This is 
mostly a bug fix release to treat a bug that reproducibly crashed the 
setup program on Windows systems.
</p><p>Further changes that have accumulated in the short time frame include:
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Color_translation_improvements"> Color translation improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> Color space translations are now also applied to gray shades. This means that now really <b>any</b>
 status bar can be fully colorized. The only exception are the gray drop
 shadows of the original IWAD status bar numbers, which are 
intentionally left untouched.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Menu_improvements"> Menu improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> In menus, numerical values are now always shown next to sliders.
</li><li> Setting mouse sensitivity to 0 now disables the corresponding axis entirely.
</li><li> The Crispness menu has got a complete overhaul:
<ul><li> The in-game "Crispness" menu now has a solid background. There 
was too much text displayed and the game graphics in the background were
 too distracting for it to remain legible.
</li><li> The menu items are now ordered into "Visual", "Tactical" and "Physical" categories.
</li><li> Disabled menu items are now indicated by darker colors.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="More_victims_of_the_feature_clean-up"> More victims of the feature clean-up </span></h3>
<ul><li> The "power up" sound is not played anymore when selecting the 
Berserker fist. This feature was hardly noticable at all and did not 
justify all the code that it required. Also, speaking about random 
non-Vanilla featuritis...
</li><li> Common mapping errors (e.g. missing sidedefs) are not fixed 
upon level setup anymore. After all, they are errors and should be fixed
 during mapping and not by the engine. But, more importantly, some 
mapping errors are demo and network game critical. However, due to the 
order in which variables are juggled around in p_setup.c, it is 
impossible to conditionally enable the fixed based on certain variables.
 Instead, I attempted to implement a separate patch, but failed and thus
 decided to drop that feature entirely.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Further_improvements_2"> Further improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> The screen wiping speed and amplitude have been adjusted to be 
closer to Vanilla. This involved removing a work-around that has been 
introduced in Crispy Doom 1.0.
</li><li> During demo playback, a thin (2 px) bar indicating demo 
progress is now printed at the bottom of the screen (similar to 
PrBoom+).
</li><li> A warning will be printed when loading a level if it contains 
unknown linedef types (i.e. line-&gt;special &gt; 141), e.g. Boom 
linedefs or generalized linedef types.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_of_Crispy_Doom_2.0_from_Crispy_Doom_1.5"> Changes of Crispy Doom 2.0 from Crispy Doom 1.5 </span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom 2.0 "Back to the Roots" has been released on October 27, 2014.
</p><p>This is a major Crispy Doom release, because it has merged the Chocolate Doom 2.1.0 release.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id=".22Back_to_the_Roots.22_campaign"> "Back to the Roots" campaign </span></h3>
<ul><li> For the current release, Crispy Doom has undergone a strict 
feature revision. Features that are considered demo or netgame critical 
but are not user-visible enough to justify a dedicated switch, have been
 removed. This has been done to avoid development two separate feature 
sets, one for demos and net games and one for regular play, and to 
generally remain closer to actual Vanilla Doom behaviour. As a rule of 
thumb, features which affect the BFG Edition support, especially the No 
Rest For The Living expansion, and features which affect level 
progression in general have been left intact. Furthermore, using cheats 
is considered at own risk (they are disabled in netgames and screw up 
demo recording anyway), so they are no longer restricted to single 
player games.
<ul><li> It is not possible anymore to switch between the regular fist and the chainsaw.
</li><li> A new level will not automatically start with the chainsaw anymore if the previous one was quit with the fist.
</li><li> The "restart level" and "go to next level" keys are considered
 as shortcuts to the IDCLEV cheat and are thus treated as such, i.e. 
they are only disabled in net games.
</li><li> The monster corpse flipping feature (based on randomization of
 monster corpse health values) is now unconditionally enabled, it is 
considered harmless.
</li><li> The vertical bobbing of ammo released by killed monsters has been removed, it has been shown to desync demos.
</li><li> The ability to gib a monster with the SSG has been removed, it
 has caused demos to instantly desync whenever it occured. However, that
 feature is not lost forever, it has already been merged into Doom Retro
 in the mean time.
</li><li> The weapon sprite is now unconditionally centered during 
shooting, but only horizontally. The vertical position affects the 
weapon lowering and raising times which in turn affect demo sync.
</li><li> The behaviour of the "Run" key when resurrecting a dead player
 has been switched. If it is held down, the most current savegame is now
 reloaded. If it is not pressed, the level now starts from scratch, just
 as in Vanilla Doom.
</li><li> Furthermore, for a cleaner diff relative to Chocolate Doom, 
the code added or changed by Crispy Doom has been extensively 
documented, commented, restructured and cleaned up where appropriate.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Support_for_BEX_files_and_lumps"> Support for BEX files and lumps </span></h3>
<ul><li> Support for DEHACKED lumps or files in the BEX format 
(established in Boom and MBF) has been added. The implementation is 
considered complete and supports the following features:
<ul><li> BITS mnemonics in regular "Things" sections,
</li><li> [CODEPTR] sections,
</li><li> [PARS] sections,
</li><li> INCLUDE directives for which the following additional rules apply:
<ul><li> DEHACKED lumps loaded from PWADs may not include files,
</li><li> files that have already been included may not include other files,
</li><li> files included with the INCLUDE NOTEXT directive will have their regular "Text" sections ignored;
</li></ul>
</li><li> [STRINGS] sections. Support for the latter has been merged 
from Chocolate Doom, but is enabled in Crispy Doom without any further 
restrictions.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Menu_improvements_2"> Menu improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> The in-game menu now has a "Crispness" item that resembles the 
same item from the crispy-setup tool. It allows to enable or disable 
most of Crispy Doom's features from inside the game without the need to 
open an external application and restart the game.
</li><li> The "permanent mouse look" switch has been added to the "Mouse Sensitivity" menu.
</li><li> During demo recording or net games, it will be impossible to 
enable certain "Crispness" features for compatibility reasons. These 
will appear as grayed out in the menu.
</li><li> Since there are no graphics for the word "Crispness" available
 in regular Doom resources, the menu item has to be renderd in the HU 
font. To avoid optical clashes with the other menu entries, these are 
now rendered in the HU font as well.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Automap_improvements_2"> Automap improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> If the "Automap stats" feature is enabled, the current map 
coordinates will be shown in the upper right corner of the Automap in a 
human readable form.
</li><li> Also, if the "Automap stats" feature is enabled and the 
current map is loaded from a PWAD, the file name of this PWAD and the 
map are displayed in the bottom left corner of the Automap.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Cheat_improvements"> Cheat improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> The IDMYPOS cheat has been improved to show the current map 
coordinates in the upper right corner in a human-readable form. This is 
the same widget that is also shown in the Automap when the "Automap 
stats" feature is enabled. It is shown twice as long as the text line 
printed by the original implementation, i.e. long enough to take a 
decent screenshot.
</li><li> The SPECHITS cheat now also triggers tag 666/667 sectors. On 
maps, where specific monsters are expected to trigger that tag, their 
actions take precedence. On any other map, the tags are triggered as 
killing all "Keen" monsters would do.
</li><li> The TNTHOM cheat has been introduced to toggle the flasing HOM detector on and off in-game.
</li><li> IDMUS0x or IDMUSx0 will not lead to crashes anymore.
</li><li> IDCLEV00 now reloads the current level and, in Doom 1, IDCLEV0x now warps to map x in the current episode.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Color_translation_improvements_2"> Color translation improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> The former static color translation tables have been replaced 
by dynamically generated ones based on actual color space translations, 
thanks Paul Haeberli. Formerly, the color translation tables were 
identical to the ones found in Boom and MBF and only covered the red 
range (palette indices 176-191, 44, 45, 47, 67) so that other colors 
were not translated at all. With the new tables, <b>any</b> color can be
 converted to any other color in the Status Bar or the HU font. Due to 
limitations in the color space translation procedure, though, gray tones
 will remain gray. Furthermore, due to limitations in the original Doom 
palette, light blue tones are often mapped to grays.
</li><li> The translucency filter table has been improved. First, the 
entire algorithm to calculate that table has been re-implemented from 
scratch, replacing the former implementation by Lee Killough found in 
Boom and MBF. Second, for the same reason mentioned before, the 
algorithm has been tuned by plums to emphasize the blue tones in the 
results.
</li><li> The translucency filter initialization routine now properly 
indicates if the TRANMAP lump has been generated or loaded from a file 
at startup.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Transparent_Crispy_HUD"> Transparent Crispy HUD </span></h3>
<ul><li> When the display size is expanded beyond the regular Crispy 
HUD, the HUD is now rendered as translucent. Of course, this only works 
if transparency is generally enabled.
</li><li> When the translucent Crispy HUD is enabled, all HU messages will be printed as translucent, too.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Laser_Pointer_improvements_2"> Laser Pointer improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> The static laser pointer introduced in Crispy Doom 1.1 has been
 removed. Its implementation has always been considered emberrassing, 
since it was merely four red pixels hard-coded into the center of the 
frame buffer.
</li><li> The new laser pointer works like a "real" laser vision spot 
and is now an actual sprite (i.e. the '+' character of the HU font) that
 is projected into the game world and shows <b>exactly</b> where the 
next shot will hit. This also means that it will lock itself to a 
monster sprite if the next shot is going to hit that monster.
</li><li> Also, the ability to change the color of the spot when a 
monster is targeted has been removed, because laser vision spots really 
just don't do that.
</li><li> It is not yet decided if the old static laser spot or the color changing feature will ever return in one form or another.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Further_improvements_3"> Further improvements </span></h3>
<ul><li> The per-line "WiggleFix" developed by kb1 and e6y has been 
applied. In the course of this, Lee Killough's int64 sprtopscreen fix 
has also been applied.
</li><li> The number of supported savegames has been raised to 8.
</li><li> In the cast shown after beating Doom 2, the monsters can now 
be rotated using the left/right keys. Furthermore, they can get skipped 
back and forth by using the strafe left/right keys and turned into gibs 
by pressing the "Run" key.
</li><li> Colored blood is now enabled on a per-monster basis. That is, 
if a monster's death sprites have been replaced by a PWAD, this 
monster's blood will not get colorized anymore. This allows for 
disabling of colored blood for specific monsters by loading a PWAD that 
merely needs to include a single lump: BOSSI0 for the Baron of Hell, 
BOS2I0 for the Hell Knight or HEADG0 for the Cacodemon. Furthermore, 
Lost souls bleeding Puffs can be disabled by replacing the SKULG0 lump 
and Spectres bleeding Spectre blood can be disabled by replacing the 
SARGI0 lump. Colored blood is generally disabled in Chex Quest (where 
monsters do not bleed, anyway) and Hacx, with the exception of the Thorn
 Thing in the latter, which now bleeds green blood.
</li><li> Lost Souls spawned by Pain Elementals now also bleed Puffs.
</li><li> In Deathmatch games, frags are now colorized in the status 
bar. Positive frags are shown in green, negative ones in red and zero 
flags appear golden.
</li><li> The red palette which is applied when the player is hurt is 
toned down a bit when the menu is active, so the latter remains legible.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Further_Bug_and_Compatibility_fixes"> Further Bug and Compatibility fixes </span></h3>
<ul><li> Since Crispy Doom 1.5, PWADs loaded with the "-file" parameter 
are treated as if they were loaded with the "-merge" parameter. This has
 lead to issues with PWADs that contain duplicate lumps once inside the 
"flats" range and once outside. To overcome this issue, lumps returned 
by the FlatNumForName() function are now restricted forcefully into the 
"flats" range (as an exception, this rule does not apply to PWADs which 
have been merged using one of the NWT-style merging parameters). Please 
note that this may cause graphical glitches in the flats rendering for 
savegames that are saved in Crispy Doom and afterwards loaded in 
Chocolate Doom. These can be avoided by loading the PWAD with the 
"-merge" parameter in Chocolate Doom as well.
</li><li> The rude extra quit messages containing profanity (feature 
introduced in Crispy Doom 1.5) have been disabled again. Their reception
 was mostly negative, and since they did not win the game anything and 
did not justify another dedicated switch, they had to go. Maybe they 
were disabled for a reason in the first place...
</li><li> The checks for the NERVE.WAD PWAD file have been simplified. 
First, the special-casing for this PWAD is not restricted to the Doom 2 
IWAD from the Doom 3 BFG Edition anymore but is now also applied if it 
is loaded alongside the regular Doom 2 IWAD. Second, the special-casing 
is not restricted to the PWAD being loaded with the "-file" command line
 parameter anymore but is now applied independent of the way the PWAD 
has been loaded.
</li><li> The check for the SSG resources has been simplified and does 
not lead to a crash anymore if a PWAD is loaded that contains the SSG 
sprites, but not its sounds (e.g. Freedoom's leftover.wad). It may not 
work when "PC Speaker" is selected for sound effects, though.
</li><li> Text lines that exceed the width of the screen will no longer lead to crashes. Thanks Dragonsbrethren for the bug report.
</li><li> The fix for the common mapping error which clears the 
ML_TWOSIDED flag when a linedef is missing a second sidedef has been 
fixed and is now only applied in single player games.
</li><li> The hackish code that checked for the "Run" key being pressed 
in the menus when selecting to quit the game has been removed. Instead, 
to speed up the exit sequence, the exit sounds are now omitted if it has
 been chosen to not show the ENDOOM screen. However, it is still 
possible to instantly quit from in-game by pressing "Run"+F10.
</li><li> Since Crispy Doom 1.1, the default movement keys were mapped 
to W, A, S and D and the keys to control the menu have served as a 
secondary mapping. However, this led to conflicts with specific key 
setups in which the menu keys were given a different meaning. Therefore,
 the original key mapping has now been reset and an alternative key set 
for forward, backward, strafe left and right has been introduced to 
which the W, A, S, D keys have been mapped. Thanks Average for reporting
 this issue.
</li><li> Unpausing in the menus during demo recording does not lead to desyncing anymore.
</li><li> The original Doom 2 bug which leads to the sky not changing between episodes has been fixed.
</li><li> The bug which caused flats getting more distorted the closer 
they are to the right of the screen has been fixed. Thanks to manny for 
reporting the bug and to bradharding for pointing me to the right code 
change.
</li><li> The newly allocated memory regions when raising the static limits are now initialized to please Valgrind.
</li><li> Holding the ESC key no longer causes the menu to repeatedly flicker on and off. Thanks joe-ilya for reporting the issue.
</li><li> Upon map initialization, unknown map things (e.g. players 5 to 8 starts) are now ignored and will not lead to crashes anymore.
</li></ul>

<p>Crispy Doom 1.5 "Supernova" has been released on August 18, 2014.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gameplay"> Gameplay </span></h3>
<ul><li> Automap improvements:
<ul><li> Exit lines are now drawn in white.
</li><li> Corpses are now shown as gray rectangles when the <tt>IDDT</tt> cheat is active.
</li><li> The disappearance of map and grid lines when zooming far out in huge maps has been fixed.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> A new, unique <tt>SPECHITS</tt> cheat has been added that triggers (by either using, shooting or crossing) all special lines available in the map <b>at once</b> -- including lines that require a key to get activated but excluding teleporters and level exits. <i>While
 this cheat may appear completely pointless at first, it has proven 
useful for debugging purposes and allows map designers to "just see what
 happens if...". Be warned, however, that using this cheat may leave the
 map in a completely inconsistent state and may cause several overflows 
and unpredictable behaviour. Furthermore, please note that doors which 
can be activated from both sides will not move at all, because they will
 be opened by one <tt>linedef</tt> and closed again by the other one in the same gametic.</i>
</li><li> The <tt>ID[K]FA</tt> cheats now give the backpack to the player.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Optional weapon recoil has been added for all weapons except 
the fist and the chainsaw, using the recoil thrust values found in MBF 
and PrBoom+. This feature has to get enabled in <i>crispy-doom-setup</i>, it is disabled by default and only generally available in regular single player games.
</li><li> The extra quit messages (<b>containing profanity!</b>) found in the source code have been enabled and are now shown with the same propability as the original messages.
</li><li> The weapon sprite now gets centered upon firing.
</li><li> When the "Quick Load" button (<tt>F9</tt>) is pressed before the game has been saved via "Quick Save" (<tt>F6</tt>),
 the regular "Load Game" menu is now shown and the selected slot is 
taken as the "Quick Save" slot. Also, the "Quick Save" slot is now 
cleared once the game is ended via "End Game" in the "Options" menu.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If the player exits a map with the Berserker fist active and is
 equiped with the chaisaw, he will start the next map with the chainsaw 
instead of the normal fist. This feature is only available in regular 
single player games.
</li><li> The "power up" sound is now played (but only audible to the <tt>consoleplayer</tt>) each time the Berserker fist is selected.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Technical"> Technical </span></h3>
<ul><li> Compatibility improvements:
<ul><li> The default amount of RAM that is allocated for the game has been doubled to <tt>32 MB</tt>, the minimal amount has been quadrupled to <tt>16 MB</tt>. 
</li><li> The "Medusa" effect from multi-patch textures has been fixed by lazily replacing (and slightly adapting) <tt>R_DrawColumnInCache()</tt>, <tt>R_GenerateComposite()</tt> and <tt>R_GenerateLookup()</tt> in <tt>src/doom/r_data.c</tt> with Lee Killough's implementations from MBF.
</li><li> The "Tutti Frutti" effect from short textures has been fixed by (again lazily) replacing <tt>R_DrawColumn()</tt> in <tt>src/doom/r_draw.c</tt> with Lee Killough's implementation from MBF. <i>However, this fix has not yet been applied to the other column drawing functions, namely <tt>R_Draw{Fuzz,Translated,TL}Column[Low]()</tt>.</i>
</li><li> The <tt>MAXVISSPRITES</tt>, <tt>MAXVISPLANES</tt> and <tt>MAXDRAWSEGS</tt> limits have been entirely removed (<i>i.e. the formerly static arrays now get resized dynamically</i>), using no Boom-derived code at all. <i>However, for performance reasons (mostly sprite ordering in <tt>R_SortVisSprites()</tt>), the <tt>MAXVISSPRITES</tt> limit is currently capped at 4096 (i.e. <tt>32 x</tt> Vanilla <tt>MAXVISSPRITES</tt> limit).</i>
</li><li> The <tt>MAXSEGS</tt> limit has been raised from <tt>32</tt> to <tt>(SCREENWIDTH/2+1)</tt>, i.e. the same value found in MBF.
</li><li> The <tt>BLOCKMAP</tt> limit has been removed, using code from PrBoom+.
</li><li> Support for extended nodes has been implemented, again using code from PrBoom+.
</li><li> The <tt>MAX_ADJOINING_SECTORS</tt> limit (<i>formerly up to <tt>20</tt> adjoining sectors</i>) has been removed, while keeping the one overflow (<i>i.e. if <tt>h == 21</tt></i>) that could possibly get emulated intact -- based on code adapted from PrBoom+.
</li><li> The Vanilla savegame and demo limits are now unconditionally disabled.
</li><li> When entering an unknown special sector, the game will not crash with an error message anymore but merely print a warning.
</li><li> The file size limit (<tt>96 kB</tt>) for MID files inside PWADs has been disabled.
</li><li> Common mapping errors (<i>e.g. missing <tt>sidedefs</tt></i>) are now fixed upon loading the maps, using code adapted from PrBoom+.
</li><li> A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Hall_of_mirrors_effect">HOM</a> is fixed if both <tt>ceilingplane</tt> and <tt>floorplane</tt> are the same visplane (e.g. both are skies).
</li><li> An integer overflow in <tt>SlopeDiv()</tt> has been fixed that formerly lead to an open subsector and thus a giant slime trail in <tt>nuts.wad</tt>.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> All of the above changes make it possible to properly play (and save, and exit, and record and playback demos in) <i>Fraken</i>maps like e.g. <tt>nuts.wad</tt>, <tt>arcadia.wad</tt> and all of <tt>NOVA.wad</tt> -- gosh, what broken mess.&nbsp;:p
</dd></dl>
<ul><li> Enemy targets and tracers are now preserved when saving and loading a game. <i>This is achieved by enumerating all thinker pointers upon saving a game and storing the corresponding indices in the <tt>mobj-&gt;target</tt> and <tt>mobj-&gt;tracers</tt>
 fields instead of the actual pointers. When loading a game, after all 
the thinkers have been restored, the reverse process is applied and all 
indices in the <tt>mobj-&gt;target</tt> and <tt>mobj-&gt;tracers</tt> 
fields are replaced by the corresponding current pointers again. This 
process is completely Vanilla compatible, as Vanilla will ignore the 
contents of the <tt>mobj-&gt;target</tt> and <tt>mobj-&gt;tracers</tt> fields anyway and overwrite them with <tt>NULL</tt> when loading a game. Otherwise, when loading a game saved in Vanilla, the contents of the <tt>mobj-&gt;target</tt> and <tt>mobj-&gt;tracers</tt> fields will not match any of the indices expected by Crispy Doom and will thus get overwritten with <tt>NULL</tt>, just as in Vanilla.</i>
</li><li> Games saved in a map with an active cube spitter will not cause a crash anymore when loaded again. <i>When awakened, the cube spitter counts the number of spawn spots and saves them in the <tt>numbraintargets</tt> variable. However, in Vanilla its value is not recalculated when loading a game. This has been fixed by calling <tt>A_BrainAwake()</tt> again if <tt>numbraintargets == 0</tt>.</i>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Mouse look improvements:
<ul><li> Vertical mouse movement has been vastly smoothened by adjusting the scale instead of the mouse delta. <i>In the former implementation the vertical mouse delta was scaled down by <tt>1/8</tt>, i.e. the lower three bits were discarded. So by moving the mouse really slowly, it was possible to not change <tt>lookdir</tt> at all when the delta on every tic was less than <tt>8</tt>.
 This has been fixed by moving the division into the rendering and slope
 calculations and scaling all the constants up by factor 8.</i> Thanks to clarry of the doomworld forum for this highly appreciated patch!
</li><li> Centering the view with the mouse button assigned to mouse 
look is now more lenient. Any click with that button that is shorter 
than <tt>6 tics</tt> will now center the view.
</li><li> The view is now smoothly centered after teleporting.
</li><li> <i>The <tt>yslope[i]</tt> array is not recalculated anymore in <tt>R_SetupFrame()</tt> for each frame when <tt>lookdir</tt> changes; instead a lookup table is calculated once in <tt>R_ExecuteSetViewSize</tt>.</i>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> All PWADs given as arguments to the "<tt>-file</tt>" parameter will now get merged as if they were passed to the "<tt>-merge</tt>" parameter.
</li><li> It is now possible to scroll through the menus with the same 
mouse buttons that are assigned for changing to the previous/next weapon
 -- which are usually mouse wheel down/up, respectively.
</li><li> If the "Run" key is pressed while the game window is closed (e.g. by clicking on the <tt>X</tt>
 button in the upper right corner) or during confirmation of the quit 
message, the game now exits instantly (in addition to the feature 
introduced in Crispy Doom 1.4).
</li><li> The background now slowly fades out when a menu is activated or the game is paused.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Additional_bug_fixes_2"> Additional bug fixes </span></h3>
<ul><li> The <tt>tranmap.dat</tt> file will not get saved in the root 
directory on Windows systems anymore, instead it will now get saved in 
the same directory as e.g. <tt>crispy-doom.cfg</tt>. <i>This was caused by an extra leading path separator in the <tt>tranmap.dat</tt> file name string.</i> Thanks to plums of the doomworld forums for the bug report.
</li><li> Visual glitches with transparent sprites caused by palette changes have now been fixed. <i>The cached translucency map in the <tt>tranmap.dat</tt> file is checked for palette changes at startup. However, in the original code derived from MBF, only the first <tt>256</tt> bytes of the palette were compared, whereas the base palette in the <tt>PLAYPAL</tt> lump has <tt>768</tt> bytes. So, changes in later palette indices went completely unnoticed.</i>
</li><li> The state of the "always run" toggle (introduced in Crispy Doom 1.3) after loading and saving a game has been fixed. <i>Enabling "always run" makes the <tt>joybspeed</tt>
 variable greater than the size of the array which holds the button 
states, which caused an out-of-bounds read in the part of the expression
 that determines whether <tt>speed</tt> should be <tt>true</tt>.</i> Thanks to clarry of the doomworld forums for the bug report and the patch!
</li><li> If things are stuck together vertically because of moving 
sectors, they are now allowed to move further apart. The fix for this 
bug has been taken from Doom Retro.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_of_Crispy_Doom_1.4_from_Crispy_Doom_1.3"> Changes of Crispy Doom 1.4 from Crispy Doom 1.3</span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom 1.4 has been released on June 12, 2014.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gameplay_2"> Gameplay </span></h3>
<ul><li> Players are now allowed to walk over or underneath shootable 
objects, i.e. monsters and barrels. This needs to be explicitely enabled
 in <i>crispy-doom-setup</i>, but is disabled by default and generally only available in single-player games.
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> Some restrictions still apply to this feature:
<ol><li> Only the player can walk over or underneath other objects, 
monsters can not. This prevents multiple monsters from piling up and 
avoids the need for more complicated measures in the code that would 
potentially break compatibility.
</li><li> It is only allowed to walk over or underneath shootable 
objects. Most other objects in Doom have arbitrary heights hard-coded 
into the engine which do not necessarily match the actual appereance in 
the game.
</li><li> Melee attacks across differences heights are entirely unaffected by this feature.
</li></ol>
</dd></dl>
<ul><li> Automap improvements: 
<ul><li> Keyed doors are now drawn in their respective colors.
</li><li> Thus, in order to distinguish red-keyed doors from regular 
walls (which were formerly drawn in red) and yellow-keyed doors from 
walls with ceiling level changes (which were formerly drawn in yellow), 
these are now drawn in darker red and yellow colors, respectively.
</li><li> Furthermore, teleporters (which were formerly drawn in just 
that darker red color) are now drawn in green. Additionally, WR 
teleporters (<i>linedef type #97</i>) are now also drawn in green if they are not secret.
</li><li> When the <tt>IDDT</tt> cheats are active:
<ul><li> Secret sector boundaries are now drawn in purple until they are revealed (<i>i.e. as long as <tt>sector-&gt;special == 9</tt></i>).
</li><li> Keys are now shown as crosses in their respective colors.
</li><li> The triangle size now represents the actual thing size.
</li><li> Countable kills are now shown as red and countable items as yellow triangles.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Episode and Map are now explicitely shown in the automap if the map title string has been modified by means of dehacked.
</li></ul>
</li><li> HUD improvements:
<ul><li> When either the God Mode cheat or the Invincibility powerup are
 active, Health and Armor values on the status bar are now printed in 
gray.
</li><li> When the fist is selected and the Berserk Pack is active, its 
sprite is now drawn into the previously empty Ammo field in the Crispy 
HUD.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Technical_2"> Technical </span></h3>
<ul><li> Gun flash sprites are now rendered translucent.
</li><li> Holding down the "Run" key while taking a screen shot now 
takes the picture without the weapon sprite or any other HUD elements.
</li><li> Holding down the "Run" key while choosing "Quit Game" now exits instantly. This actually turns <tt>Shift+F10</tt> into an emergency "Boss Key".&nbsp;;)
</li><li> The presence of MAP33 is not hard-coded to the <tt>doom2.wad</tt> IWAD file of the BFG Edition anymore. Instead, it is now checked at startup and the level progression (i.e. <i>MAP02-(secret exit)-&gt;MAP33-&gt;MAP03</i>) is adapted accordingly.
</li><li> Once a savegame has been rejected to continue from after 
player death (by holding down the "Run" key during resurrection, feature
 introduced in Crispy Doom 1.3) it is not considered anymore until 
loaded or saved again.
</li><li> The <tt>IDCLEVxy</tt> cheat now eats key presses, i.e. the second digit of the level number is not interpreted as a weapon selection anymore.
</li><li> When using the <tt>-warp</tt> command line parameter for Doom 1, the episode and map numbers do not have to be separated by spaces anymore.
</li><li> The flashing HOM indicator (introduced in Crispy Doom 1.3) has been turned into a command line option <tt>-flashinghom</tt> and now flashes even when the <tt>NOCLIP</tt> cheat is active. Without this option, though, HOMs are still drawn in black but do not flash in red anymore.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_of_Crispy_Doom_1.3_from_Crispy_Doom_1.2"> Changes of Crispy Doom 1.3 from Crispy Doom 1.2 </span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom 1.3 has been released on May 19, 2014.
</p>
<ul><li> Crispy Doom now has its own icon! It is is composed of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/File:Chocolate-logo.png">Chocolate Doom icon</a> and a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Potato-Chips.jpg">photo</a> of potato crisps (Utz-brand, grandma's kettle-cooked style) by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Evan-Amos">Evan-Amos</a> who kindly released it into the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="New_features_2"> New features </span></h3>
<ul><li> A "quick reverse" key has been added.
</li><li> A key to toggle "always run" has been added, set to <tt>Caps Lock</tt> by default.
</li><li> Keys have been added to "go to the next level" and to "reload 
the current level", but left unset by default (based on code taken from 
PrBoom+).
</li><li> Support to invert the mouse on the vertical axis has been added.
</li><li> It is now possible to toggle between Fist and Chainsaw even 
without the Berserk pack applied, not available in demo 
recording/playback and netgame mode.
</li><li> Boom's <tt>TNTEM</tt> and <tt>TNTWEAPx</tt> cheats as well as PrBoom+'s/ZDoom's <tt>NOTARGET</tt> cheat have been implemented.
</li><li> The Automap is now updated while playing.
</li><li> The Automap markers are now centerd on the map. 
</li><li> Vertical aiming (introduced in Crispy Doom 1.2) is now 
optional, since it may have some severe undesired effects on gameplay. 
It can be enabled in <i>crispy-doom-setup</i>, but is disabled by default and in demo recording/playback and netgame mode.
</li><li> The corpse flipping randomization (introduced in Crispy Doom 1.2) has been improved by improving corpse health randomization. <i>The
 flipping decision is based on the monster health after death. However, 
since some weapons do only apply damage in multiples of (multiples of) 
2, the distribution was uneven. In Crispy Doom 1.3, moster health is now
 reduced by <tt>target-&gt;tics &amp; 1</tt>, which itself is randomized by <tt>target-&gt;tics -= P_Random()&amp;3</tt> before. Thus, a more even distribution is achived across all weapons and monster types.</i> Furthermore, the Barrel has been added as an exception that should not have its death animation flipped (thanks Doom Retro).
</li><li> The lethal pellet of a point-blank SSG blast may now get an 
additional damage boost to achieve an occasional gib chance, disabled in
 demo recording/playback and netgame mode. <i>This only happens if the target is within melee range (i.e. if <tt>P_CheckMeleeRange(target)</tt> returns <tt>true</tt>) and if <tt>damage &gt;= 10</tt> for the lethal pellet, which roughly corresponds to a 2/3 chance.</i>
</li><li> If the player dies and the game has been loaded or saved 
before in the current level, that savegame is now reloaded instead of 
restarting the entire level from scratch. However, since this behaviour 
may be undesired, it is possible to suppress it by holding the "Run" key
 during resurrection.
</li><li> The player view is now centered when the player dies or hits hard ground (the latter only when mouse look is disabled).
</li><li> Existing demo files with the same file name are now saved from
 getting overwritten by adding a file name suffix. That is, if you run 
e.g. <tt>crispy-doom -record demo</tt> and a file called <tt>demo.lmp</tt> does already exist, Crispy Doom will now save the new demo as <tt>demo-000.lmp</tt>, or <tt>demo-001.lmp</tt> if that does also exist, etc.
</li><li> Entering menus while recording demos will now pause the game to prevent <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Demo_desyncing_caused_by_menu_access">instant desyncing</a>.
</li><li> A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/HOM">HOM indicator</a> has been added that flashes between black and red (but remains black if the <i>noclip</i> cheat is active).
</li><li> Chocolate Doom 2.0.0 clients are now allowed to connect to Crispy Doom servers.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Experimental_features"> Experimental features </span></h3>
<ul><li> The "flipped levels" feature has been ported over (i.e. "stolen") from Strawberry Doom. To try this out, add the <tt>-fliplevels</tt> parameter to the command line.
</li><li> The SSG is now also available in Doom 1 if the required resources are made available. To try this out, run the game via e.g. <tt>crispy-doom -iwad doom.wad -merge doom2.wad doom.wad</tt> and type <tt>IDKFA</tt> or <tt>TNTWEAP9</tt>.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Other_bug_fixes"> Other bug fixes </span></h3>
<ul><li> The tutti-frutti effect which appeared around the weapon sprite under certain circumstances has been fixed.
</li><li> A crash has been fixed when an Automap marker reaches the border of the map.
</li><li> A bug that made the status bar and the face visible under certain circumstances when using the <i>noclip</i> cheat has been fixed.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Non-Doom_Ports"> Non-Doom Ports </span></h3>
<ul><li> Due to popular demand, the non-Doom games that are part of 
Chocolate Doom have now been added back into the release. However, they 
have not seen any development since the Crispy Doom 1.0 release and are 
strictly <b>unsupported</b>. Feature requests are accepted if accompanied by patches.&nbsp;;-)
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_of_Crispy_Doom_1.2_from_Crispy_Doom_1.1"> Changes of Crispy Doom 1.2 from Crispy Doom 1.1 </span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom 1.2 has been released on April 10, 2014.
It is mostly a bug fix release to fix the jerky mouse look in Crispy 
Doom 1.1. If you were unsatisfied with the mouse look performance of 
Crispy Doom 1.1 it is highly recommended to upgrade to Crispy Doom 1.2:
</p>
<ul><li> Unjerkify mouse look.
<ul><li> In Crispy Doom 1.1 vertical mouse movement changed the <tt>look</tt> variable which decided how the actual <tt>player-&gt;lookdir</tt> variable will be changed in the next game tic. However, the <tt>look</tt>
 variable is intended for keyboard use and changes the lookdir in rather
 coarse steps. The code has been changed to now act directly on the <tt>player-&gt;lookdir</tt> variable which provides for a much smoother mouse look.
</li><li> Mouse sensitivity selection is moved into a separate sub-menu of the Options menu.
</li><li> Allow to set separate values for horizontal and vertical mouse sensitivity in both the Options menu and in <i>crispy-doom-setup</i>.
</li><li> Increase mouse sensitivity thermometer range up to 20.
</li><li> Fix a crash in the Options menu when mouse sensitivity exceeds
 the maximum value. Instead, allow to exceed the thermometer range and 
print values next to it.
</li><li> Fix slopes for bullets and missiles that would not have hit a 
target anyway. This means that missed shots will now go into the actual 
vertical direction looked into. However, auto-aim will still work and 
guide shots to their aim. This feature is only enabled in single-player 
games (though probably harmless).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Monster death sprites and corpses are now flipped randomly. 
While the idea is stolen from Doom Retro, the implementation is 
completely different. The flipping decision is based on the value of <tt>thing-&gt;health</tt>, which is randomized in Doom, since all damage done by weapons is already randomized. Once a monster is dead (i.e. <tt>thing-&gt;flags &amp; MF_CORPSE</tt>), this value remains constant. Although probably harmless, this feature is also only available in single-player games.
</li><li> Fix different view frames for normal fullscreen mode and Crispy HUD.
</li><li> Fix a crash when attempting to test settings from <i>crispy-doom-setup</i>, merged from Chocolate Doom.
</li><li> Fix "fast doors make two closing sounds" and "fast doors reopening with wrong sound" engine bugs.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_of_Crispy_Doom_1.1_from_Crispy_Doom_1.0"> Changes of Crispy Doom 1.1 from Crispy Doom 1.0 </span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom 1.1 has been released on April 5, 2014.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Visual_Enhancements"> Visual Enhancements </span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Minimal HUD:</b> When the view size is increased one step 
beyond fullscreen, a minimal HUD is displayed which only shows the 
numbers of the status bar without its background.
</li><li> <b>Colored Patches and Sprites:</b> Color translation lookup 
tables have been ported over from Boom 2.02. They can be used to 
(optionally) colorize the numbers on the status bar, the HUD font and 
also the blood of certain monsters.
<ul><li> <b>Colored Status Bar Number:</b> The numbers displayed in the 
status bar or the minimal HUD can get colorized depending on their 
value. If enabled, health is colored red, yellow, green or blue for 
values up to 25%, 50%, 100% and above 100% respectively. Ammo is colored
 red, yellow and green for values up to 25%, 50%, 100% of the <i>initial</i>
 maximum ammo, respectively. Excess ammo, that can only be carried when a
 backpack has been found, gets colored blue. Armor is colored green or 
blue depending on the type of armor the player currently wears, red 
means no armor. Colored numbers in the status bar can be enabled in the <i>crispy-doom-setup</i> tool and are disabled by default.
</li><li> <b>Colored Blood:</b> Blood is now colored depending on the 
monster class. Spectres and invisible players will now bleed spectre 
blood, Lost Souls will now bleed Puffs (<i>since spawning Puffs demands the RNG differently than spawning Blood, this feature is only enabled in single player games</i>), Cacodemons bleed blue blood and Hell Knights and Barons of Hell bleed green blood. <i>This feature required pointing the <tt>target</tt> field of the blood <tt>mobj_t struct</tt> to the monster <tt>mobj_t struct</tt> and furthermore the addition of another field to the <tt>vissprite_t struct</tt> to keep track of the object that a sprite belongs to. This is considered <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1254800">harmless</a>, though).</i>
</li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Translucency:</b> Translucency support has been ported over
 from Boom 2.02. As in Boom, the nececssary color tinting lookup table 
is created once at startup and then cached on the hard disk for 
subsequent uses, alternatively it can be supplied as a lump or in a PWAD
 file. The same objects as in Boom 2.02 have been tagged as translucent 
in <tt>mobjinfo[]</tt>. Additionally, rocket and barrel explosions, Lost
 Soul and Pain Elemental explosions, and the explosions of the Boss 
Brain (Icon of Sin) have been tagged translucent. Also, if a monster 
gets resurrected by an Arch Vile from a pool of blood and turns into a "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Ghost_monster">ghost monster</a>" it will rise from the dead as translucent. Translucency can generally be enabled in the <i>crispy-doom-setup</i> tool and is disabled by default.
</li><li> <b>Shaded Menus:</b> The background is shaded when a menu is 
active or when the game is paused. Furthermore, menu entries that 
currently make no sense, e.g. <i>Save Game</i> or <i>End Game</i> when no game is active, are shaded. Also, empty savegame slots are shaded in the <i>Load Game</i> menu.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Enhancements_affecting_gameplay"> Enhancements affecting gameplay </span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Free Look:</b> Free look support has been ported over from 
Chocolate Hexen. It is now possible to look up and down up to a certain 
degree using the keyboard or mouse. Using the latter, it is possible to 
change the viewing angle by pressing a certain key and moving the mouse 
vertically. Single-clicking that key without moving the mouse will 
center the view again. It is furthermore possible to activate permanent 
mouse look. Mouse viewing may feel a bit jerky, because the view angle 
is only increased in integers. To enable mouse viewing without also 
enabling vertical mouse movement, the "<tt>-novert</tt>" command line parameter had to be modified to only apply to vertical <i>translational</i> movement. Since both free look and permanent mouse look require stretching the sky texture, they need to get enabled in the <i>crispy-doom-setup</i> tool and are disabled by default.
</li><li> <b>Jumping:</b> Jumping support has been ported over from Chocolate Hexen. It needs to get enabled in the <i>crispy-doom-setup</i>
 tool and is of course disabled by default. Since jumping involves 
in-air movement which may cause demos or network games to desync, this 
feature is entirely disabled when not in a single player game.
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> <i>To achieve the above two features without sacrificing savegame compatibility with Chocolate Doom, a new <tt>player2_t struct</tt>
 has been introduced into the code to hold the additional 
player-speficic variables. This means that viewing angle and jumping 
state are not saved in savegames.</i>
</dd></dl>
<ul><li> <b>Autorun:</b> When the autorun feature is active, using the "run" key will result in walking at normal speed.
</li><li> <b>Laser Pointer:</b> A red laser pointer dot can be shown in 
the center of the screen to help for aiming. Optionally, the color of 
the dot can change from red to yellow if a target is within reach. Both 
options need to be enabled in the <i>crispy-doom-setup</i> tool and are disabled by default.
</li><li> <b>Secret Message:</b> A centered "A secret is revealed!" 
message is printed in a golden font and a sound is played when a secret 
is found. This can be enabled in the <i>crispy-doom-setup</i> tool and is disabled by default.
</li><li> <b>Automap stats:</b> Additional level statistics can be shown
 in the automap, including the number of kills, items and secrets as 
well as the level time. This feature needs to be enabled in the <i>crispy-doom-setup</i> tool and is disabled by default.
</li><li> <b>Ammo Bob:</b> Ammo or weapons released by killed enemies will slightly bob vertically (<i>this feature is only available in a single player game</i>).
</li><li> <b>Engine Bugs:</b> The "Ouch Face" and the "Picked up a Medikit that you really need" messages are shown as intended.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Technical_Enhancements"> Technical Enhancements </span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Vertical Mouse Movement:</b> Separate values for mouse acceleration and threshold can now be applied for the vertical axis in the <i>crispy-doom-setup</i> tool.
</li><li> <b>PNG Screenshots:</b> Screenshots can now be taken in PNG 
format. This feature has been merged from Chocolate Doom and is now the 
default in Crispy Doom. Also, a dedicated key can be set for taking 
screenshots, including the "Print Screen" key.
</li><li> <b>Automatic loading of DEHACKED lumps:</b> Chocolate Doom has got the ability to load DEHACKED lumps embedded in PWAD files via the "<tt>-dehlump</tt>"
 command line parameter. This feature has been merged into Crispy Doom 
and is now the default. It can be disabled, though, via the "<tt>-nodehlump</tt>" or "<tt>-nodeh</tt>" command line parameters. The latter does additionally disable the special treatment of the <tt>chex.wad</tt> and <tt>hacx.wad</tt> IWAD files and the <tt>nerve.wad</tt>
 PWAD file. Furthermore, error handling has been made more tolerant for

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Non-Doom_Ports_2"> Non-Doom Ports </span></h3>
<p>The non-Doom games that are part of Chocolate Doom have fallen behind
 in terms of development and haven't seen any significant changes since 
Crispy Doom 1.0. Thus, only Doom is included in the 1.1 release and will
 be from now on.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_of_Crispy_Doom_1.0_from_Chocolate_Doom_2.0.0"> Changes of Crispy Doom 1.0 from Chocolate Doom 2.0.0 </span></h2>
<p>Crispy Doom 1.0 has been released on March 10, 2014.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Display_Resolution"> Display Resolution </span></h3>
<ul><li> The display resolution in all four games (Doom, Heretic, Hexen 
and Strife) has been doubled in both horizontal and vertical direction, 
resulting in a 640x400 native resolution.
</li><li> Additionally, in Crispy Doom, the <i>Graphic Detail: Low</i> 
mode has been modified to halve the display resolution also in the 
vertical direction (unlike Vanilla and Chocolate Doom, which only halve 
the resolution in the horizontal direction in this mode). As a result, 
in Crispy Doom in <i>Graphic Resolution: Low</i> mode the screen is rendered <b>exactly</b> identical to Chocolate Doom in <i>Graphic Resolution: High</i> mode.
</li><li> An additional <i>mode_squash_1p5x</i> video mode has been 
introduced which stretches the screen by factor 1.25 horizontally and by
 factor 1.5 vertically. This results in a 800x600 display resolution to 
provide for a intermediate resolution suitable for vintage monitors.
</li></ul>
<p>Due to the increased display resolution, the supported video modes 
differ from Chocolate Doom. The following table gives an overview over 
the available video modes in Crispy Doom 1.0 and Chocolate Doom 2.0.0. A
 red backgrond color means that a video mode has been disabled in 
fullscreen mode for quality concerns. Additionally, all video modes that
 would result in a display resolution exceeding <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WUXGA">WUXGA</a> (1920x1200) have been disabled in Crispy Doom.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Improved_Support_for_the_BFG_Edition"> Improved Support for the BFG Edition </span></h3>
<p>Chocolade Doom has no support for <i>No Rest for the Living</i>, 
because its maps require a limit-removing source port. However, with its
 raised static limits there is no more reason to not add full support 
for this expansion to Crispy Doom.
</p><p>If the IWAD loaded with Crispy Doom is recognized as <tt>doom2.wad</tt> shipped with the Doom 3: BFG Edition, the following changes apply:
</p>
<ul><li> The maximum number of levels (<tt>NUMCMAPS</tt>) is raised to 33, the secret exit in MAP02 leads to MAP33 and the exit there leads back to MAP03.
</li></ul>
<p>If furthermore the <tt>nerve.wad</tt> PWAD file can be found and no other PWAD files are loaded, the following additional changes apply:
</p>
<ul><li> The <tt>nerve.wad</tt> PWAD file is automatically loaded at startup, the level name patch lumps (<tt>CWILVxx</tt>) are renamed to not collide with regular Doom 2 ones.
</li><li> An additional submenu as added to the New Game menu that 
allows for selection of either Hell on Earth (i.e. regular Doom 2) of No
 Rest For The Living.
</li></ul>
<p>If otherwise the nerve.wad PWAD file is loaded via the "<tt>-file nerve.wad</tt>" parameter, the following additional changes apply:
</p>
<ul><li> The name of the expansion is shown in the window title and the game banner.
</li><li> The <tt>TITLEPIC</tt> lump is replaced with the <tt>DMENUPIC</tt> lump.
</li></ul>
<p>If either "No Rest For The Living" is selected from the New Game menu or if the <tt>nerve.wad</tt> PWAD file is loaded via the "<tt>-file nerve.wad</tt>" parameter, the following changes apply:
</p>
<ul><li> The level names in the automap and on the interlevel screen are adjusted.
</li><li> The level music and par times are adjusted.
</li><li> The secret exit in MAP04 leads to MAP09 and the exit there leads back to MAP05.
</li><li> It is not possible to enter levels after MAP09 via <i>IDCLEVxx</i> cheat.
</li><li> There is no "<i>Now entering...</i>" screen shown after level 8.
</li><li> The intermission screen after level 6 is replaced by another one after level 8 with adjusted text.
</li><li> The Doom 2 cast sequence is shown after level 8.
</li></ul>
<p>Please note that all of the above changes do <b>only</b> apply for the <tt>doom2.wad</tt> IWAD file from the BFG Edition; they do <b>not</b> apply for the regular <tt>doom2.wad</tt> IWAD file. Consequently, it is still possible to play the <tt>nerve.wad</tt> PWAD file as a regular PWAD without special treatment if loaded alongside the regular <tt>doom2.wad</tt> IWAD file.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Compatibility"> Compatibility </span></h2>
<ul><li> In order to distinguish the NRFTL levels from the regular Doom 2 levels, Crispy Doom uses the <tt>gameepisode</tt>
 variable, which is used in Doom 1 to distinguish between the game 
episodes but is hitherto unused in Doom 2. This means that savegames 
recorded in Crispy Doom are still <b>compatible</b> to Cholate Doom (because it ignores the <tt>gameepisode</tt> variable in Doom 2) but may not be <b>identical</b>.
 Consequently, savegames that have been recorded playing NRFTL in Crispy
 Doom can be loaded in Chocolate Doom if the latter is invoked with "<tt>-file nerve.wad</tt>". On the other hand, savegames that are recorded in Chocolate Doom with the "<tt>-file nerve.wad</tt>" parameter cannot immediately be loaded in Crispy Doom without the "<tt>-file nerve.wad</tt>" parameter. In order to "convert" savegames to Crispy Doom, run it with the "<tt>-file nerve.wad</tt>" parameter, load the savegames and save them again. It should then be possible to load them without the "<tt>-file nerve.wad</tt>" parameter in Crispy Doom.
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> Please note that the introduction of full support for NRFTL 
means breaking with Chocolate Doom's objectives to remain as close to 
the original DOS <tt>doom.exe</tt> as possible.
</dd></dl>
<ul><li> The minimal Crispy Doom HUD is displayed when <tt>blocksize == 12</tt>, which isn't supported by Chocolate Doom. To retain config file compatibility, quit the game with any other view size.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The "flipped levels" and "SSG available in Doom 1" features introduced in Crispy Doom 1.3 are considered strictly <b>experimental</b>!
 They may produce savegames, demo files or netgames that are not 
compatible with Chocolate Doom, Vanilla Doom or previous versions of 
Crispy Doom at all.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The <tt>SPECHITS</tt> cheat introduced in Crispy Doom 1.5 may 
leave a map in a completely inconsistent state and games saved after 
using it may even cause Vanilla to crash by exceeding static limits.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Games saved with Crispy Doom 1.5 or later are still <b>compatible with Vanilla Doom</b>, but are <b>not identical</b> anymore to the files that Vanilla Doom would have saved. This is caused by the fact that Crispy Doom preserves the <tt>mobj-&gt;target</tt> and <tt>mobj-&gt;tracers</tt>
 fields when saving a game by replacing their contents with specific 
indices. These indices are then converted back into the corresponding 
pointers in Crispy Doom when the game is loaded again. In Vanilla Doom, 
however, the contents of the <tt>mobj-&gt;target</tt> and <tt>mobj-&gt;tracers</tt> fields are disregarded and get overwritten with <tt>NULL</tt> when loading the game. Games saved in Vanilla Doom, on the other hand, still contain pointers in the <tt>mobj-&gt;target</tt> and <tt>mobj-&gt;tracers</tt> fields, but these will not match any of the indices expected by Crispy Doom and will thus get overwritten with <tt>NULL</tt> as in Vanilla Doom.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Furthermore, the position of the weapon sprite is stored in 
savegames. While this is always centered when firing in Crispy Doom 1.5,
 its position actually varies in Vanilla Doom.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Since Crispy Doom 2.0, in order to overcome issues when merging
 PWADs with duplicate lumps of the same name, lumps that are meant to be
 used as flats are restricted between the F_START and F_END markers. 
This requirement may lead to graphical glitches when savegames are 
shared between Crispy Doom and Chocolate Doom, which in turn can be 
avoided by loading the PWAD with "-merge" instead of "-file" in 
Chocolate Doom.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> In order to fix an issue with inventory items in Strife, the 
Chocolate Doom network gaming code had to be incompatibly changed a few 
days after the Chocolate Doom 2.1.0 release. While Crispy Strife 2.0 and
 2.1 preserved compatibility with the old (buggy) code, the Crispy 
Strife 2.2. release is network game incompatible with Chocolate Strife 
2.1.0 and requires its development version for cross-port network games.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Acknowledgement"> Acknowledgement </span></h2>
<p>Although I have played the thought of hacking on Chocolate Doom's renderer for quite some time already, it was Brad Harding's <a href="http://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Doom_Retro" title="Doom Retro">Doom Retro</a>
 that provided the incentive to finally do it. However, his fork aims at
 a different direction and I did not take a single line of code from it.
 Lee Killough's <a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF" class="extiw" title="doom:MBF">MBF</a> was studied and used to debug the code, especially in the form of Team Eternity's <a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/WinMBF" class="extiw" title="doom:WinMBF">WinMBF</a> source port, which made it easier to compile and run on my machine. And of course there is fraggle's <a href="http://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom" title="Chocolate Doom">Chocolate Doom</a>
 with its exceptionally clean and legible source code. Please let me 
take this opportunity to appreciate all these authors for their work!
