Chocolate Doom is a Doom source port which aims to behave as closely
as possible to the original DOS Doom executables.

Chocolate Doom aims to:

 * Be compatible with DOS Doom demos
 * Be compatible with DOS Doom configuration files
 * Be compatible with DOS Doom savegames
 * Be compatible with DOS Doom bugs
 * Provide the same "feel" as DOS Doom (display and input should behave
   the same)
 * As far as possible, provide all the same features that are available
   using the DOS version.

== Configuration File ==

Chocolate Doom is compatible with the DOS Doom configuration file
(normally named 'default.cfg').  Existing configuration files for
DOS Doom should therefore simply work out of the box.  However,
Chocolate Doom also provides some extra settings.  These are stored
in a separate file named 'chocolate-doom.cfg'.

The configuration can be edited using the chocolate-setup tool.

== Command-line options ==

For a complete list of command-line options, see the CMDLINE 
file.

== Playing TCs ==

With Vanilla Doom there is no way to include sprites in PWAD files.  
Chocolate Doom's '-file' command line option behaves exactly the
same as Vanilla Doom, and trying to play TCs by adding the WAD files
using '-file' will not work.

Many Total Conversions (TCs) are distributed as a PWAD file which must
be merged into the main IWAD.  Typically a copy of DEUSF.EXE is
included which performs this merge.  Chocolate Doom includes a new
option, '-merge', which will simulate this merge.  Essentially, the 
WAD directory is merged in memory, removing the need to modify the 
IWAD on disk.

To play TCs using Chocolate Doom, run like this:

  chocolate-doom -merge thetc.wad

Here are some examples:

  chocolate-doom -merge batman.wad -deh batman.deh      (Batman Doom)
  chocolate-doom -merge aoddoom1.wad -deh aoddoom1.deh  (Army of Darkness Doom)
