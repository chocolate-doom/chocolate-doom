To do:

* Joystick/gamepad support.
* Install packages:
  - Debian/Ubuntu .deb packages, Fedora .rpm packages.
  - Windows NSIS installer.
  - MacOS X .dmg packages (should be universal binaries!)
* Better icon for chocolate-setup.
* Free version of the Chocolate Doom logo (from scratch, not using the 
  Doom imp sprite), so t-shirts can be printed!
* Automatic WAD installer - download and run TCs from a list automatically
  (automating the current "instructions on wiki" system)
* Demo hashes for regression testing of this and other ports.
* Multiplayer:
  - Master server for locating servers automatically - makes setting up
    public servers easier.
  - DWANGO-like interface for finding players and setting up games.
  - Incorporate local LAN search into setup interface.
  - Multiplayer options and configuration file (server name, etc)
* Improve multiplayer startup: 
  - Select an IWAD automatically from the server's game type rather than
    all players having to specify -iwad.
  - Send list of WADs to load instead of all clients having to specify -file.
  - Same applies to dehacked patches and wad merging parameters.
* MSVC build
* Portability improvements:
  - Use size-specific types (eg. int32_t instead of int)
  - Don't make structure packing assumptions when loading levels.
* OPL emulation
* Port to every OS under the sun
* Video capture mode?
