2007-03-27 00:19:22 fraggle
	
	Fix manpage copyright footer to include id as well as me.

2007-03-26 13:09:53 fraggle
	
	Search WAD search dirs when loading dehacked patches.

2007-03-19 16:44:49 fraggle
	
	Update TODO; PC speaker is supported now.

2007-03-16 22:26:06 fraggle
	
	Add back shiftxform table so that the shift key works in multiplayer
	chat when vanilla_keyboard_mapping is enabled.

2007-03-16 21:43:28 fraggle
	
	Add config file option to enable/disable native keyboard bindings.

2007-03-16 05:07:35 rtc_marine
	
	Update codeblocks project

2007-03-15 18:43:22 fraggle
	
	Change MD5 code to use the standard types used elsewhere in the
	program.

2007-03-15 18:38:55 fraggle
	
	Use SDL for endianness byte swapping.  m_swap.c removed; m_swap.h
	renamed to i_swap.h.

2007-03-14 13:05:03 fraggle
	
	Use SDL's built-in audio conversion routines to convert sound effects
	to the output mixer device's sample rate.  Simplistic (naive)
	resampling in cases where SDL's routines can't do a conversion.  This
	needs a bit more work to filter out the high frequency artifacts at
	48khz output rate.

2007-03-12 12:38:54 fraggle
	
	Change "sound effects enabled" checkbox to a dropdown, allowing PC
	speaker to be selected as well.

2007-03-10 07:48:21 rtc_marine
	
	Minor changes:
	* No more shared libraries on windows, because they suck anyway and
	  complicate things
	* Fix build virtual targets

2007-03-10 05:40:12 fraggle
	
	Ignore the HOME environment variable on Windows - just behave like
	Vanilla Doom.

2007-03-10 02:11:18 rtc_marine
	
	Lots of changes/additions:
	* Add libpcsound codeblocks project
	* Use libraries that are built and project dependencies inside main
	  chocolate-doom/setup project and remove source files.
	* libraries are now built in the "lib" top level directory
	* Fix some warnings

2007-03-09 23:30:46 fraggle
	
	Add pcsound Linux driver.

2007-03-09 23:03:24 fraggle
	
	Don't build console mode apps; use the default -mwindows until the
	stdout.txt/stderr.txt thing can be fixed.

2007-03-09 22:50:48 fraggle
	
	Move the pcsound library to the top level, alongside textscreen.

2007-03-09 22:20:28 fraggle
	
	Partially revert the last change.  I'm going with a mixed approach for
	handling key mappings.  Chocolate Doom will use the original (broken)
	Doom behavior, in that keys will be unmapped.  A German user will have
	to type "IDMZPOS", for example.  However, when actually entering text,
	for savegame names and multiplayer chat, the mapped character will be
	used.  The reasoning here is that Vanilla users will be used to
	pressing the wrong keys, but it can never be desirable to use the
	wrong mappings when typing in text.

2007-03-09 12:56:45 fraggle
	
	Pay closer attention to keyboard mappings.  In the menu code,
	distinguish between keys pressed and characters typed, so that, for
	example, when the menu prompts "press 'y' to continue", it responds to
	the _character_ y being typed, not the key that is 'y' on an american
	keyboard being pressed.  Do the same when reading cheats.

2007-03-09 12:35:18 fraggle
	
	Fix discrepancy between Doom and setup program when prompting for
	keys.  Add the ability to enable/disable key mappings so that the raw
	key can be read in setup, exactly the same way that it is in Doom.

2007-03-07 23:52:33 rtc_marine
	
	Update project Fix a warning

2007-03-07 19:08:27 fraggle
	
	Use native endianness for sound output, rather than always LSB.  Add
	PC speaker code!

2007-02-24 02:30:17 fraggle
	
	Fix up setup tool to display the video driver setting tabulated with
	all the other settings.

2007-02-24 02:26:02 fraggle

	Fix compile errors.

2007-02-23 23:41:58 fraggle
	
	Add an extra option to chocolate-setup on Windows to allow the video
	driver to be selected from directx and windib.

2007-02-23 23:26:26 fraggle
	
	Add a configuration file value to allow the SDL video driver to be
	explicitly specified.

2007-02-15 21:51:53 fraggle
	
	Really fix the menu corruption bug.

2007-02-14 19:11:30 fraggle
	
	Make I_Error call abort() instead of exit(), so that we can get a
	backtrace in the debugger.

2007-02-14 19:11:03 fraggle
	
	Expand buffer length to fix bug on Windows with cycling character on
	the quicksave screen.

2007-02-14 19:10:30 fraggle
	
	Read sound length as a 32 bit field, not 16 bit.  Fixes death sound in
	marina.wad.

2007-02-10 03:19:30 fraggle
	
	Don't prepend a superfluous './' to the path when searching the
	current directory for an IWAD.

2007-02-07 13:04:46 fraggle
	
	Revert previous change: throwing away the key state seems to be the
	Doom 1.9 behavior.

2007-02-07 12:58:53 fraggle
	
	Don't throw away keypress state when passing between levels - allows
	shift to be held down for run when moving between levels.  Thanks to
	Zack Friedrich <zack18@comcast.net> for pointing this out.

2007-02-01 12:21:14 fraggle
	
	Search IWAD search directories when loading PWAD files.

2007-01-14 05:20:28 fraggle
	
	Fix savegamedir directory generation.

2007-01-14 05:04:37 fraggle
	
	Change interpretation of DOOMWADDIR to the classic behavior: a single
	directory path where an IWAD can be found.  Add DOOMWADPATH as a
	PATH-style list of directories to search for IWADs.  This is to
	maintain consistency/compatibility with other ports, and so that the
	DOOMWADDIR name makes sense.

2007-01-08 22:46:05 fraggle
	
	More helpful SDL_mixer error messages.

2007-01-08 22:45:18 fraggle

2007-01-06 03:26:00 fraggle

	"Always run" trick should only be when joyb_speed >= 10.  Use 29 as

	by setup.exe.

2006-09-16 01:04:59 fraggle
	
	Preserve 'comport' variable in configuration files even though it is

	configuration file and act the same as Vanilla Doom.

	the widget that owns the callback the program doesnt crash.

2006-09-02 20:10:07 fraggle
	
	Add -nwtmerge option, which behaves the same as NWT's -merge option.
	What this does is load a PWAD, then search through the IWAD sprites
	list, removing lumps where there are lumps of the same name in the
	PWAD.  The PWAD must then be loaded again with the normal -file
	option.  This is needed to run TiC's Obituary TC: chocolate-doom
	-nwtmerge obtic2.wad -file obtic1.wad obtic2.wad -deh obtic1.deh Also

	Loading/saving multiplayer games should all work now.

2006-09-01 21:07:25 fraggle
	
	Better spechits emulation.  Remove support for emulating the
	higher-memory spechits overruns, as they will overwrite pointers with
	garbage and crash the game.  Change the spechits base address to one
	from doom2.exe, which seems to work better in more cases.  Add
	-spechit command-line parameter to allow the base address to be
	explicitly specified if necessary.

2006-08-31 23:11:08 fraggle
	
	Call R_ExecuteSetViewSize immediately after calling I_InitGraphics.
	I_InitGraphics can change where screens[0] points to, so the player
	can end up with a blank screen sometimes.  Thanks to Kurn for
	reporting this.

	multiplayer game start window.

	Add key and mouse input widgets for selecting keys and mouse buttons.

2006-08-31 19:13:23 fraggle
	
	Check for 'ff_end' not 'ff_start' when displaying warning message
	about merging flats.  Some old Vanilla WADs used ff_start..f_end to
	add extra flats and this message should not be displayed for them.  Use
	American spelling of 'behavior'.

2006-08-31 19:13:04 fraggle
	
	Allow the demo size limit to be disabled through the config file.

2006-08-31 19:12:43 fraggle

	Exit the main loop automatically after all windows are closed

	Add window listener functions to allow spying on keys and mouse
	buttons received by windows.  Emit a 'closed' signal when a window is
	closed.  Allow windows to have no action buttons.

2006-08-31 19:11:07 fraggle
	
	Change name of escape window actions to 'Close' and add a separate
	'Abort' button creator.

2006-08-31 19:10:49 fraggle
	
	Center the calculator in the window.

2006-08-31 19:09:34 fraggle
	
	Add TXT_SelectWidget function to select a widget in a table,

	screen, as Vanilla Doom does.

	code plays the deca.wad titlescreen music properly!

2006-07-24 22:32:39 fraggle
	
	Oops :-)

2006-07-22 17:43:12 fraggle
	
	New mus -> mid conversion code thanks to Ben Ryves
	<benryves@benryves.com> This plays back a lot of music closer to
	Vanilla Doom - eg.  tnt.wad map02

2006-06-29 19:07:32 fraggle
	
	Add inverted checkboxes (tick in box when value is false)

2006-06-29 19:05:32 fraggle
	
	Initial mouse configuration window.

2006-06-29 10:05:54 fraggle
	
	Hugely refactor the response file loading code.  Allow arguments to be
	enclosed in quotes; this allows long filenames with spaces in to be
	specified with -file in response files.

2006-06-21 20:08:20 fraggle
	
	Let the SDL parachute catch crashes and shut down properly.  Don't

	Add a fake nonfunctional key bindings configuration menu.

2006-06-20 19:48:21 fraggle

	the dw forums).

2006-06-16 18:06:05 fraggle
	
	Add hash table for fast texture lookup; refactor P_GroupLines to use
	an O(n) rather than O(n^2) algorithm: faster loading maps like sid.wad
	map03

2006-06-03 19:23:09 fraggle
	
	Stop sending data to the server when a connection drops.  Print a
	message to the console as well.

	Detect recursive calls to I_Error to prevent an infinite loop.

2006-06-03 13:38:24 fraggle

	textscreen: Rejig how the entire drawing process works.  Add a
	recursive layout method that assigns the position and size of widgets

	dedicated servers (no need to allocate an entire heap).

2006-03-24 19:55:04 fraggle
	
	Make memblock_t internal to z_zone.c.  Adjust Z_ChangeTag #define to
	cope with this.

2006-03-24 17:35:17 fraggle
	
	Update TODO.  Remove finished things (64-bit, netcode) and stuff which

2006-03-16 21:46:59 fraggle
