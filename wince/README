Windows CE is a horribly crippled operating system.  The poor thing doesn't
even include a complete implementation of the ANSI standard C library.  This
is a mini-library called libc_wince that implements some of the missing
library functions.  I've only implemented those necessary to get Chocolate
Doom to compile.

On non-Windows CE platforms it is just built as an empty library.
