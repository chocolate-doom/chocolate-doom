The Chocolate Doom icon was created by Sam Hewitt 
(http://samuelhewitt.com/) and may be used under the GNU GPL, so 
the copyright status of the icon is the same as that of the rest of the project.

The "foo8.ico" files are 8-bit depth only, while the "foo.ico" files
contain full 32-bit versions, scaled to different sizes and with proper
alpha masks (as well as the 8-bit versions).  The 8-bit versions are
used when setting the icon within SDL, as SDL under Windows displays
full color icons in a very poor quality.  The full-color versions are
used in the resource files.
