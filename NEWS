1.2.1 (2008-12-10):

    This version just fixes a crash at the intermission screen when
    playing Doom 1 levels.

1.2.0 (2008-12-10):

    Happy 15th Birthday, Doom!

     * Chocolate Doom now has an icon that is not based on the proprietary
       Doom artwork.
     * There is now memory-mapped WAD I/O support, which should be useful
       on some embedded systems.
     * Chex quest emulation support is now included, although an
       auxiliary dehacked patch is needed (chexdeh.zip in the idgames
       archive).

    Compatibility:
     * The armor class is always set to 2 when picking up a megasphere
       (thanks entryway).
     * The quit screen prompts to quit "to dos" instead of just to quit
       (thanks MikeRS)
     * The "dimensional shambler" quit message was fixed.
     * Fix crash related to A_BFGSpray with NULL target when using
       dehacked patches - discovered with insaned2.deh
       (thanks CSonicGo)
     * NUL characters are stripped from dehacked files, to ensure correct
       behavior with some dehacked patches (eg. the one with portal.wad).

    Bugs fixed:
     * "Python Image Library" should have been "Python Imaging Library"
       (thanks exp(x)).
     * The setup tool should no longer ask for elevated permissions
       on Windows Vista (this fix possibly may not work).
     * The application icon is set properly when running under Windows
       XP with the "Luna" theme.
     * Fix compilation under Cygwin to detect libraries and headers from
       the correct environment.
     * The video code does not try to read SDL events before SDL has
       been properly initialised - this was causing problems with some
       older versions of SDL.

1.1.1 (2008-04-20):

    The previous release (v1.1.0) included a bug that broke compilation
    when libsamplerate support was enabled.  The only change in this 
    version is to fix this bug.

1.1.0 (2008-04-19):

     * The video mode code has been radically restructured.  The video mode is
       now chosen by directly specifying the mode to use; the scale factor is
       then chosen to fit the screen.  This is helpful when using widescreen
       monitors (thanks Linguica)
     * MSVC build project files (thanks GhostlyDeath and entryway).
     * Unix manpage improvements; the manpage now lists the environment
       variables that Chocolate Doom uses.  Manpages have been added for
       chocolate-setup and chocolate-server, from the versions for the Debian
       Chocolate Doom package (thanks Jon Dowland).
     * INSTALL file with installation instructions for installing Chocolate
       Doom on Unix systems.
     * Support for high quality resampling of sound effects using 
       libsamplerate (thanks David Flater).
     * A low pass filter is applied when doing sound resampling in an
       attempt to filter out high frequency noise from the resampling
       process.
     * R_Main progress box is not displayed if stdout is a file (produces
       cleaner output).
     * Client/server version checking can be disabled to allow different
       versions of Chocolate Doom to play together, or Chocolate Doom
       clients to play with Strawberry Doom clients.
     * Unix manpages are now generated for the Chocolate Doom 
       configuration files.
     * The BSD PC speaker driver now works on FreeBSD.

    Compatibility:
     * Use the same spechits compatibility value as PrBoom+, for consistency
       (thanks Lemonzest).
     * The intercepts overrun code has been refactored to work on big
       endian machines.
     * The default startup delay has been set to one second, to allow 
       time for the screen to settle before starting the game (some 
       monitors have a delay before they come back on after changing modes).
     * If a savegame buffer overrun occurs, the savegame does not get saved
       and existing savegames are not overwritten (same behaviour as 
       Vanilla).

    Bugs fixed:
     * Desync with STRAIN demos and dehacked Misc values not being set
       properly (thanks Lemonzest)
     * Don't grab the mouse if the mouse is disabled via -nomouse or use_mouse
       in the configuration file (thanks MikeRS).
     * Don't center the mouse on startup if the mouse is disabled (thanks
       Siggi).
     * Reset the palette when the window is restored to clear any screen
       corruption (thanks Catoptromancy).
     * mus2mid.c should use MEM_SEEK_SET, not SEEK_SET (thanks Russell)
     * Fast/Respawn options were not being exchanged when starting netgames
       (thanks GhostlyDeath).
     * Letterbox mode is more accurately described as "pillarboxed" or 
       "windowboxed" where appropriate (thanks MikeRS)
     * Process affinity mask is set to 1 on Windows, to work around a 
       bug in SDL_mixer that can cause crashes on multi-core machines
       (thanks entryway).
     * Bugs in the joystick configuration dialog in the setup tool have
       been fixed.

1.0.0 (2007-12-10):

    This release is dedicated to Dylan 'Toke' McIntosh, who was
    tragically killed in a car crash in 2006.  I knew Dylan
    from IRC and the Doomworld forums for several years, and he had
    a deep passion for this game.  He was also a huge help for me while
    developing Chocolate Doom, as he helped point out a lot of small
    quirks in Vanilla Doom that I didn't know about. His death is a 
    great loss.  RIP Toke.

    This is the first release to reach full feature parity with 
    Vanilla Doom.  As a result, I have made this version 1.0.0, so
    Chocolate Doom is no longer beta!

    Big new features:
     * Multiplayer!  This version includes an entirely new multiplayer
       engine, based on a packet server architecture.  I'd like to thank
       joe, pritch, Meph and myk, and everyone else who has helped test
       the new code for their support, feedback and help in testing this.  
       The new code still needs more testing, and I'm eager to hear any 
       feedback on this.
     * A working setup tool.  This has the same look and feel as the 
       original setup.exe.  I hope people like it!  Note that it has 
       some advantages over the original setup.exe - for example, 
       you can use the mouse.

    Other new features:
     * New mus conversion code thanks to Ben Ryves.  This converts the
       Doom .mus format to .mid a lot better.  As one example, tnt.wad
       Map02 is now a lot closer to how Vanilla says.  Also, the music 
       on the deca.wad titlescreen now plays!
     * x3, x4 and x5 display scale (thanks to MikeRS for x5 scale).
     * Fullscreen "letterbox" mode allows Chocolate Doom to run on machines
       where 1.6:1 aspect ratio modes are unavailable (320x200/640x400).
       The game runs in 320x240/640x480 instead, with black borders.
       The system automatically adjusts to this if closer modes are 
       unavailable.
     * Aspect ratio correction: you can (also) run at 640x480 without black 
       borders at the top and bottom of the screen.
     * PC speaker sound effect support.  Chocolate Doom can output real
       PC speaker sounds on Linux, or emulate a PC speaker through the
       sound card.
     * Working three-screen mode, as seen in early versions of Doom!
       To test this out, put three computers on a LAN and type:
         chocolate-doom -server
	 chocolate-doom -autojoin -left
	 chocolate-doom -autojoin -right
     * Allow a delay to be specified on startup, to allow the display to
       settle after changing modes before starting the game.
     * Allow the full path and filename to be specified when loading demos:
       It is now possible to type 'chocolate-doom -playdemo /tmp/foo.lmp'
       for example.
     * Savegames are now stored in separate directories depending on
       the IWAD: eg. the savegames for Doom II are stored in a different
       place to those for Doom I, Final Doom, etc. (this does not affect
       Windows).
     * New mouse acceleration code works based on a threshold and 
       acceleration.  Hopefully this should be closer to what the DOS
       drivers do.  There is a 'test' feature in the setup tool to help 
       in configuring this.
     * New '-nwtmerge' command line option that emulates NWT's '-merge'
       option.  This allows TiC's Obituary TC to be played.
     * The ENDOOM screen no longer closes automatically, you have to click
       the window to make it go away.
     * Spechit overrun fixes and improvements.  Thanks to entryway for
       his continued research on this topic (and because I stole your
       improvements :-).  Thanks to Quasar for reporting a bug as well.
     * Multiple dehacked patches can be specified on the command line,
       in the same way as with WADs - eg. -deh foo.deh bar.deh baz.deh.
     * Default zone memory size increased to 16MB; this can be controlled
       using the -mb command-line option.
     * It is now possible to record demos of unlimited length (by default, 
       the Vanilla limit still applies, but it can now be disabled).
     * Autoadjusting the screen mode can now be disabled.
     * On Windows, the registry is queried to detect installed versions of
       Doom and automatically locate IWAD files.  IWADs installed through
       Steam are also autodetected.
     * Added DOOMWADPATH that can be used like PATH to specify multiple 
       locations in which to search for IWAD files.  Also, '-iwad' is 
       now enhanced, so that eg. '-iwad doom.wad' will now search all 
       IWAD search paths for 'doom.wad'.
     * Improved mouse tracking that should no longer lag.  Thanks to 
       entryway for research into this.
     * The SDL driver can now be specified in the configuration file.  
       The setup tool has an option on Windows to select between
       DirectX and windib.
     * Joystick support.
     * Configuration file option to change the sound sample rate.
     * More than three mouse buttons are now supported.
     
    Portability improvements: 
     * Chocolate Doom now compiles and runs cleanly on MacOS X.  Huge
       thanks go to Insomniak who kindly gave me an account on his machine
       so that I could debug this remotely.  Big thanks also go to 
       athanatos on the Doomworld forums for his patience in testing 
       various ideas as I tried to get Chocolate Doom up and running
       on MacOS.
     * Chocolate Doom now compiles and runs natively on AMD64.
     * Chocolate Doom now compiles and runs on Solaris/SPARC, including
       the Sun compiler.  Thanks to Mike Spooner for some portability 
       fixes.
     * Improved audio rate conversion, so that sound should play properly
       on machines that don't support low bitrate output.

    Compatibility fixes:
     * Check for IWADs in the same order as Vanilla Doom.
     * Dehacked code will now not allow string replacements to be longer than
       those possible through DOS dehacked.
     * Fix sound effects playing too loud on level 8 (thanks to myk
       for his continued persistence in getting me to fix this)
     * Save demos when quitting normally - it is no longer necessary to
       press 'q' to quit and save a demo.
     * Fix spacing of -devparm mode dots.
     * Fix sky behavior to be the same as Vanilla Doom - when playing in
       Doom II, the skies never change from the sky on the first level
       unless the player loads from a savegame. 
     * Make -nomouse and config file use_mouse work again.
     * Fix the -nomusic command-line parameter.  Make the snd_sfxdevice
       snd_musicdevice values in the configuration file work, so that it
       is possible to disable sound, as with Vanilla.
     * Repeat key presses when the key is held down (this is the Vanilla 
       behavior)  - thanks to Mad_Mac for pointing this out.
     * Don't print a list of all arguments read from response files - Vanilla
       doesn't do this.
     * Autorun only when joyb_speed >= 10, not >= 4.  Thanks to Janizdreg 
       for this.
     * Emulate a bug in DOS dehacked that can overflow the dehacked
       frame table and corrupt the weaponinfo table.  Note that this means
       Batman Doom will no longer play properly (identical behavior
       to Vanilla); vbatman.deh needs to also be applied to fix it.
       (Thanks grazza)
     * Allow dehacked 2.3 patches to be loaded.
     * Add more dehacked string replacements.
     * Compatibility option to enable or disable native key mappings.  This
       means that people with non-US keyboards can decide whether to use
       their correct native mapping or behave like Vanilla mapping (which
       assumes all keyboards are US).
     * Emulate overflow bug in P_FindNextHighestFloor.  Thanks to
       entryway for the fix for this.
     * Add -netdemo command line parameter, for playing back netgame
       demos recorded with a single player.
     * The numeric keypad now behaves like Vanilla Doom does.
     * Fix some crashes when loading from savegames.
     * Add intercepts overrun emulation from PrBoom-plus.  Thanks again
       to entryway for his research on this subject.
     * Add playeringame overrun emulation.

    Bugs fixed:
     * Fix crash when starting new levels due to the intermission screen
       being drawn after the WI_ subsystem is shut down (thanks 
       pritch and joe)
     * Catch failures to initialise sound properly, and fail gracefully.
     * Fix crasher in 1427uv01.lmp (thanks ultdoomer)
     * Fix crash in udm1.wad.
     * Fix crash when loading a savegame with revenant tracer missiles.
     * Fix crash when loading a savegame when a mancubus was in the middle
       of firing.
     * Fix Doom 1 E1-3 intermission screen animations.
     * Fix loading of dehacked "sound" sections.
     * Make sure that modified copyright banners always end in a newline
       - this fixes a bug with av.wad (thanks myk)
     * Added missing quit message ("are you sure you want to quit this
       great game?").
     * Fix when playing long sound effects - the death sound in marina.wad
       now plays properly, for example.
     * Fix buffer overrun on the quicksave prompt screen that caused a
       mysterious cycling character to appear.
     * IDCLEV should not work in net games (thanks Janizdreg)
     * Stop music playing at the ENDOOM screen.
     * Fix sound sample rate conversion crash.
     * Fix 'pop' heard at the end of sound effects.
     * Fix crash when playing long sounds.
     * Fix bug with -timedemo accuracy over multi-level demos.
     * Fix bug with the automap always following player 1 in multiplayer
       mode (thanks Janizdreg).

0.1.4 (2006-02-13):

    NWT-style merging command line options (allows Mordeth to be played)
    Unix manpage (thanks Jon Dowland)
    Dehacked improvements/fixes:
     * Allow changing the names of graphic lumps used in menu, status bar
       intermission screen, etc.
     * Allow changing skies, animated flats + textures
     * Allow changing more startup strings.
     * Allow text replacements on music + sfx lump names
    Fix for plutonia map12 crash.
    Fix bug with playing long sfx at odd sample rates.
    Big Endian fixes (for MacOS X).  Thanks to athanatos for helping
        find some of these.
    Install into /usr/games, rather than /usr/bin (thanks Jon Dowland)

0.1.3 (2006-01-20):

    Imported the spechit overrun emulation code from prboom-plus.  Thanks to
         Andrey Budko for this.
    New show_endoom option in the chocolate-doom.cfg config file allows
         the ENDOOM screen to be disabled.
    Chocolate Doom is now savegame-compatible with Vanilla Doom.

    Fixes for big endian machines (thanks locust)
    Fixed the behavior of the dehacked maximum health setting.
    Fix the "-skill 0" hack to play without any items (thanks to Janizdreg
        for pointing out that this was nonfunctional)
    Fix playing of sounds at odd sample rates (again).  Sound effects at
        any sample rate now play, but only sounds with valid headers.
        This is the *real* way Vanilla Doom behaves.  Thanks to myk for
        pointing out the incorrect behavior.

0.1.2 (2005-10-29):

    Silence sounds at odd sample rates (rather than bombing out); this
        is the way Vanilla Doom behaves.
    Handle multiple replacements of the same sprite in a PWAD.
    Support specifying a specific version to emulate via the command line
        (-gameversion)
    Fix help screen orderings and skull positions.  Behave exactly as
        the original executables do.

0.1.1 (2005-10-18):
    Display startup "banners" if they have been modified through 
        dehacked.
    Dehacked "Misc" section support.

    Bugs fixed:
     * Doom 1 skies always using Episode 1 sky
     * Crash when switching applications while running fullscreen
     * Lost soul bounce logic (do not bounce in Registered/Shareware)
     * Mouse buttons mapped incorrectly (button 1 is right, 2 is middle)
     * Music not pausing when game is paused, when using SDL_mixer's 
       native MIDI playback.
     * Pink icon on startup (palette should be fully set before anything is
       loaded)

0.1.0 (2005-10-09):
    Dehacked support
    WAD merging for TCs
    ENDOOM display
    Fix bug with invalid MUS files causing crashes
    Final Doom fixes

0.0.4 (2005-09-27):
    Application icon and version info included in Windows .exe files
    Fixes for non-x86 architectures
    Fix uac_dead.wad (platform drop on e1m8 should occur when all
        bosses die, not just barons)
    Fix "loading" icon to work for all graphics modes

0.0.3 (2005-09-17):
    Mouse acceleration code to emulate the behaviour of old
        DOS mouse drivers (thanks to Toke for information about 
        this and suggestions)
    Lock surfaces properly when we have to (fixes crash under
        Windows 98)

0.0.2 (2005-09-13):
    Remove temporary MIDI files generated by sound code.
    Fix sound not playing at the right volume
    Allow alt-tab away while running in fullscreen under Windows
    Add second configuration file (chocolate-doom.cfg) to allow 
        chocolate-doom specific settings.
    Fix switches not changing in Ultimate Doom

0.0.1 (2005-09-07):
    First beta release
