0.2.0 (???):
    Multiplayer!  This version includes an entirely new multiplayer
    engine, based on a packet server architecture.  I'd like to thank
    joe, pritch, Meph and myk for their support, feedback and help in 
    testing this.  The new code still needs more testing, and I'm eager
    to hear any feedback on this.

    Fullscreen "letterbox" mode allows Chocolate Doom to run on machines
    where 1.6:1 aspect ratio modes are unavailable (320x200/640x400).
    The game runs in 320x240/640x480 instead, with black borders.
    The system automatically adjusts to this if closer modes are 
    unavailable.

    Portability improvements: 
     * Chocolate Doom now compiles and runs cleanly on MacOS X.  Huge
       thanks go to Insomniak who kindly gave me an account on his machine
       so that I could debug this remotely.  Big thanks also go to 
       athanatos on the Doomworld forums for his patience in testing 
       various ideas as I tried to get Chocolate Doom up and running
       on MacOS.
     * Chocolate Doom now compiles and runs natively on AMD64.

    Bugs fixed:
     * Check for IWADs in the same order as Vanilla Doom
     * Fix crash when starting new levels due to the intermission screen
       being drawn after the WI_ subsystem is shut down (thanks 
       pritch and joe)
     * Catch failures to initialise sound properly, and fail gracefully.
     * Fix sound effects playing too loud on level 8 (thanks to myk
       for his continued persistence in getting me to fix this)
     * Fix crasher in 1427uv01.lmp (thanks ultdoomer)

0.1.4 (2006-02-13):

    NWT-style merging command line options (allows Mordeth to be played)
    Unix manpage (thanks Jon Dowland)
    Dehacked improvements/fixes:
     * Allow changing the names of graphic lumps used in menu, status bar
       intermission screen, etc.
     * Allow changing skies, animated flats + textures
     * Allow changing more startup strings.
     * Allow text replacements on music + sfx lump names
    Fix for plutonia map12 crash.
    Fix bug with playing long sfx at odd sample rates.
    Big Endian fixes (for MacOS X).  Thanks to athanatos for helping
        find some of these.
    Install into /usr/games, rather than /usr/bin (thanks Jon Dowland)

0.1.3 (2006-01-20):

    Imported the spechit overrun emulation code from prboom-plus.  Thanks to
         Andrey Budko for this.
    New show_endoom option in the chocolate-doom.cfg config file allows
         the ENDOOM screen to be disabled.
    Chocolate Doom is now savegame-compatible with Vanilla Doom.

    Fixes for big endian machines (thanks locust)
    Fixed the behavior of the dehacked maximum health setting.
    Fix the "-skill 0" hack to play without any items (thanks to Janizdreg
        for pointing out that this was nonfunctional)
    Fix playing of sounds at odd sample rates (again).  Sound effects at
        any sample rate now play, but only sounds with valid headers.
        This is the *real* way Vanilla Doom behaves.  Thanks to myk for
        pointing out the incorrect behavior.

0.1.2 (2005-10-29):

    Silence sounds at odd sample rates (rather than bombing out); this
        is the way Vanilla Doom behaves.
    Handle multiple replacements of the same sprite in a PWAD.
    Support specifying a specific version to emulate via the command line
        (-gameversion)
    Fix help screen orderings and skull positions.  Behave exactly as
        the original executables do.

0.1.1 (2005-10-18):
    Display startup "banners" if they have been modified through 
        dehacked.
    Dehacked "Misc" section support.

    Bugs fixed:
     * Doom 1 skies always using Episode 1 sky
     * Crash when switching applications while running fullscreen
     * Lost soul bounce logic (do not bounce in Registered/Shareware)
     * Mouse buttons mapped incorrectly (button 1 is right, 2 is middle)
     * Music not pausing when game is paused, when using SDL_mixer's 
       native MIDI playback.
     * Pink icon on startup (palette should be fully set before anything is
       loaded)

    Dehacked support
    WAD merging for TCs
    ENDOOM display

0.0.4 (2005-09-27):
    Application icon and version info included in Windows .exe files

        bosses die, not just barons)
    Fix "loading" icon to work for all graphics modes

0.0.3 (2005-09-17):
    Mouse acceleration code to emulate the behaviour of old
        DOS mouse drivers (thanks to Toke for information about 
        this and suggestions)
    Lock surfaces properly when we have to (fixes crash under
        Windows 98)

    Remove temporary MIDI files generated by sound code.
    Fix sound not playing at the right volume
