* What is it? *

Chocolate Strife is the most accurate and complete recreation of Rogue
Entertainment's "Strife: Quest for the Sigil." It was created through more than
four years of reverse engineering effort with the blessings of the original
programmers of the game.


* Why? *

The source code for Strife was lost, which means, unlike the code for all the
other commercial DOOM-engine games, it cannot be released. The only access we
have to the code is the binary executable file. Tools such as IDA Pro have
been employed to disassemble and decompile the executable, which was cross-
referenced against the Linux DOOM and DOS Heretic sources and painstakingly
combed over multiple times, instruction-by-instruction, to ensure that the
resulting Chocolate Doom-based executable is as close as possible to the
original.


* Is it Legal? *

Chocolate Strife was originally reverse-engineered from the DOS Strife
binaries. Although reverse engineering is legally a protected activity, this
nonetheless left some open questions about its legal status.

In 2014, a new commercial release of Strife was published (Strife: Veteran
Edition) based on the Chocolate Strife code, and developed by the authors of
Chocolate Strife under commercial license. The release of Strife: Veteran
Edition, along with its GPL-licensed source code, constitutes tacit approval
for the legal status of Chocolate Strife by its current copyright holder.


* Is it Perfect? *

Almost, but not entirely! That's where you come in. Help us by reporting any
discrepancies you may notice between this executable and the vanilla DOS
program!

However, do *not* report any glitch that you can replicate in the vanilla EXE
as a bug. The point of Chocolate Strife, like Chocolate Doom before it, is to
be as bug-compatible with the original game as possible. Also be aware that
some glitches are impossible to compatibly recreate, and wherever this is the
case, Chocolate Strife has erred on the side of not crashing the program,
for example by initializing pointers to NULL rather than using them without
setting a value first.


* What are some known problems? *

- The demo version is *not* supported, and there are not any current plans
  to support it in the future, due to the vast number of differences (the
  demo version of Strife is based on a much earlier beta version of Rogue's
  codebase). You should use a commercial Strife IWAD file, preferably of
  version 1.2 or later.


* How do I use it? *

From the Run box or a command line, issue a command to Chocolate Strife just
like you would run Chocolate Doom. Most of the same command line parameters
are supported.

voices.wad will be read from the same directory as the IWAD, if it can be
found. If it is not found, then voices will be disabled just as would happen
with the vanilla executable. Do not add voices.wad using -file, as that is
redundant and unnecessary.

Some new command-line parameters in Chocolate Strife include the following:

-nograph
  Disables the graphical introduction sequence. -devparm implies this.

-novoice
  Disables voices even if voices.wad can be found.

-work
  Enables Rogue's playtesting mode. Automatic godmode, and pressing the
  inventory drop key will toggle noclipping.

-flip
  Flips player gun graphics. This is buggy, however, because it does not
  reverse the graphics' x offsets (this is an accurate emulation of the
  vanilla engine's behavior).

-random
  Randomizes the timing and location of item respawns in deathmatch, when
  item respawning is enabled.
