Chocolate Doom installation
===========================

These are instructions for how to install Chocolate Doom on Unix-like
Operating Systems.

Dependencies
------------

Chocolate Doom requires the following to be installed:

 * A C compiler (gcc is recommended)
 * make (GNU make is recommended)
 * LibSDL (see http://www.libsdl.org/)
 * SDL_mixer
 * SDL_net
 * Python (optional)

Building Chocolate Doom
-----------------------

On a Unix system, follow the standard instructions for installing an 
autotools-based package:

 1. Run './configure' to initialise the package.
 2. Run 'make' to compile the package.
 3. Run 'make install' to install the package.

Advanced topics such as cross-compilation are beyond the scope of this 
document.  Please see the GNU autoconf / automake documentation for more
information.

Installing an IWAD file
-----------------------

To play Doom, an IWAD file is needed. This contains the Doom game data.  The
file usually has one of the following filenames:

   doom1.wad                   (Shareware Doom)
   doom.wad                    (Registered / Ultimate Doom)
   doom2.wad                   (Doom 2)
   tnt.wad                     (Final Doom: TNT: Evilution)
   plutonia.wad                (Final Doom: Plutonia Experiment)

When you have this file (see the next section, "Obtaining an IWAD file", for 
how to get this file), install it through one of the following methods:

 * Put the file into the /usr/share/games/doom or 
   /usr/local/share/games/doom directories.
 * Install it into a directory and set the environment variable DOOMWADDIR to
   be the path to that directory.
 * Install multiple IWADs into separate directories and set the environment
   variable DOOMWADPATH to be a colon-separated list of directories to search
   (similar to the Unix PATH environment variable).
 * Run Chocolate Doom with the '-iwad' command line parameter to specify the
   IWAD file to use, eg.

       chocolate-doom -file /root/doom2.wad

Obtaining an IWAD file
----------------------

Obtaining the IWAD file may be a complicated process under Unix.  The method
depends on how you obtained your copy of the game:

 * There have been several CD-based versions of Doom.  Generally, the IWAD
   files can be found on the CD and copied off directly.

 * The IWAD files may not be directly available on the CD.  Look for a program
   named "deice.exe".  In the same directory, there should be a single large
   file with a numbered extension (eg. "resource.1"); to extract this, follow
   the same instructions as for the floppy disk version (see below).

 * If you have the floppy disk version of Doom, first copy the contents of all
   the floppy disks into a directory together.  You will have several large
   files with numbered extensions.  Concatenate these into a single file, eg.

       cat doom_se.1 doom_se.2 doom_se.3 doom_se.4 doom_se.5 > doom_se.exe

   The resulting file is self-extracting LHA file.  If you have a DOS emulator
   (such as DOSbox), you can run it to extract the files; alternatively, you
   can use the Unix LHA tool to extract the archive.

 * The Doom games are also available for download on Steam
   (http://www.steampowered.com/).  To find the IWAD files, look in your Steam
   directory, under the "steamapps/common" path.  

Installing upgrades
-------------------

Chocolate Doom requires a Doom 1.9 IWAD file.  Generally, if you install a
recent version of Doom you should automatically have a 1.9 IWAD.  However, if
you are installing from a very old CD version or from floppy disks, you might
find you have an older version.  

The most obvious symptom of an out of date IWAD file is that the game will
exit at the title screen before the demo starts, with the message "Demo is
from a different game version!".  If this happens, your IWAD file is out of
date and you need to upgrade.

Id Software released upgrade patches that will update your game to 1.9.  Look
on doomworld.com for the patches.  As the patches are binary patches that run
as DOS executables, you will need a DOS emulator (such as DOSBox) to install
them.
