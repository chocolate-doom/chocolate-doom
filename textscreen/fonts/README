 * normal.png is the standard DOS font, from the DOSbox project.

 * small.png contains a miniature, half-size font for low-resolution
   displays. This is based on the Atari-Small font by Tom Fine. The
   original font was standard ASCII only; this has been extended to the
   full Extended ASCII range with scaled-down versions of the full-size
   DOS font. Original copyright notice:
