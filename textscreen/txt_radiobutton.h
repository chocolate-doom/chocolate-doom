/**
 * A radio button widget.
 *
 * Radio buttons are typically used in groups, to allow a value to be
 * selected from a range of options.  Each radio button corresponds
 * to a particular option that may be selected.  A radio button
 * has an indicator to indicate whether it is the currently-selected
 * value, and a text label.
 *
 * Internally, a radio button tracks an integer variable that may take
 * a range of different values.  Each radio button has a particular
 * value associated with it; if the variable is equal to that value,
 * the radio button appears selected.  If a radio button is pressed
 * by the user through the GUI, the variable is set to its value.
 *
 * When a radio button is selected, the "selected" signal is emitted.
