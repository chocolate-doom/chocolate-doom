To do:

* Aspect ratio correction - stretch 320x200 to 320x240, 640x480, etc.
* Automatic WAD installer - download and run TCs from a list automatically
  (automating the current "instructions on wiki" system)
* On Windows, search the Final Doom/Doom Collector's Edition install 
  dirs for IWADs.
* Demo hashes for regression testing of this and other ports.
* Improve multiplayer startup: 
  - Select an IWAD automatically from the server's game type rather than
    all players having to specify -iwad.
  - Send list of WADs to load instead of all clients having to specify -file.
  - Same applies to dehacked patches and wad merging parameters.
* Portability improvements:
  - Use size-specific types (eg. int32_t instead of int)
  - Don't make structure packing assumptions when loading levels.
* Video capture mode?
