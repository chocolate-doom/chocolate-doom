Chocolate Doom Installer that installs the files at "C:\Users%USERNAME%\Documents\My Games\Doom"
Includes an uninstaller to delete all of the files installed.
Does not require admin permissions because it installs on a per user basis.
Adds start menu shortcuts.

Only important file is the "Chocolate Doom Installer.exe". The "INSTALL.BAT" and "UNINSTALL.BAT" are there because this project is open source.
